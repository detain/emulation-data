            "description": "Nintendo is a consumer electric company based in Japan. While they are best known for there hit video gaming consoles such as the Super Nintendo, Nintendo 64, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS, and the Nintendo Wii. Nintendo’s roots date back to 1889 where it originally produced handmade playing cards.\nIt wasn’t till 1974 that Nintendo finally made a foray into Video Games and the home video console market. Their first venture was obtaining the redistribution rights for the Magnavox Odyssey video game console in Japan, it would be another three years before Nintendo would finally begin manufacturing their own hardware. There first attempt was the Colour TV-Game, while 6 versions were released they were all variations of the same game, Light Tennis.\nNintendo’s  success in the games industry however did not come till the 1980 with the launch of their first handheld video game console, the Game & Watch. These only featured one specific game that was tied to the hardware unlike Nintendo’s future handhelds that implemented to swap in and out cartridges. The next 20 years would see Nintendo further entrench themselves as a company to watch out for in the games industry with loveable franchises and hugely successful consoles.\nOver the 20 years consumers would see the release of several consoles that are firmly entrenched as a part of gaming history. 1985 saw the release of the  Famicon which was also known as the Nintendo Entertainment System(NES). The Famicon was released alongside ports of Nintendo’s arcade games. They also introduced the practice of bundling games helping make Super Mario Bros as one of the best selling video games of all time.\n1989 was the year for the Game Boy to take the stage. The handheld console was born from merging the idea of the Game & Watch with the NES’s ability to interchange cartridges.The Game Boy managed to kick start Nintendo’s dominance over the handheld console market, a dominance that has managed to last many years to come. The success was again partly thanks to Nintendo’s bundling strategies, with the Game Boy’s bundling of 3rd party game Tetris being an instant success.",

            "description": "Sony Corporation is a company that focusses on professional electronics, gaming, entertainment, and even financial service. Even though Sony was founded back in 1946, the company wouldn’t break into the gaming world for another 49 years.\nDespite its late start in the gaming industry, Sony has continually proven itself to be a dominant force in the industry.\n<h2 class=\"border-bottom\"><span class=\"console_icons ps1_icon align-middle\"></span> PlayStation 1</h2>\nOn the 3rd of December, 1994 in Japan, Sony made a move into the gaming market with the release of its very first gaming console, the PlayStation 1 (Commonly referred to as the PS1, PS, and PSX).\nThe PlayStation proved to be both a critical and commercial success and paved Sony’s way to becoming one of the most dominant forces in the gaming industry. Sony is regarded as the largest game console business and one of the largest game publishers in the world.\nThe original PlayStation saw the release of numerous critically acclaimed games, such as the release of Gran Turismo, Crash Bandicoot, Final Fantasy VII, Metal Gear Solid, and much more.\nThis wealth of games helped Sony position themselves in the  gaming market as a force to be reckoned with.\n<h2 class=\"border-bottom\"><span class=\"console_icons ps2_icon align-middle\"></span> PlayStation 2</h2>\nWith the release of the PlayStation 2 in the year 2000, Sony successfully solidified its dominance in the gaming market with the PS2 selling over 155 million units during its lifespan.\nThe console was so successful that Sony kept its production running well into the life span of the PlayStation 3 with the production ending in 2013.\nThe PS2’s growth was helped by the continual release of high-quality games such as God Of War, Ratched & Clank, Kingdom Hearts, and many more.\n<h2 class=\"border-bottom\"><span class=\"console_icons PS3_icon align-middle\"></span> PlayStation 3</h2>\nSix years later, Sony released the PlayStation 3 as its successor to the widely successful PS2. The PS3 had a slow start due to it releasing later than its competitors and sporting a higher price tag.\nHowever, the PS3 still rallied to be a commercially successful release, selling over 87 million units during its lifespan.\nThis success was spurred on by a release of substantial new exclusive hits such as Metal Gear Solid 4, Little Big Planet, Killzone 2, the Uncharted series, The Last of Us, and many more.\n<h2 class=\"border-bottom\"><span class=\"console_icons ps4_icon align-middle\"></span> PlayStation 4</h2>\nSony’s current latest offering is the PlayStation 4. Released in late 2013, the PS4 has been a massive success for the company, selling over 100 million units.\nThe PS4 saw Sony regain its market dominance in the console industry, thanks in part to the lackluster release of the Nintendo Wii U and the marketing nightmare that was the original release of the Xbox One.\nSony continued its strong lineup of exclusive first-party and third-party games for the PS4.\nThe PS4 saw the release of many critically acclaimed games such as the new Spider-Man game, God of War, Uncharted 4, Horizon Zero Dawn, Detroit Become Human, Bloodborne, and many more.\n<h2 class=\"border-bottom\">PlayStation 5</h2>\nSony hopes to continue its dominance in the gaming market with the release of the PlayStation 5 in 2020.\nWhile few details are known about this upcoming console, one thing is for sure is that Sony will ensure it releases with a solid lineup of games.\n<h2 class=\"border-bottom\"><span class=\"console_icons psp_icon align-middle\"></span> PlayStation Portable</h2>\nWhile Sony has proven dominant in the console market, they didn’t successfully manage to translate this to the handheld game market.\nWith Nintendo’s Nintendo DS series selling incredibly well, Sony tried to get in on the market with the release of its handheld game console called the PlayStation Portable or PSP.\nEven though the PSP still managed to sell over 80 million units, this was small in comparison to that of the Nintendo DS, which sold over 288 million units over its four different models.\nThe PlayStation Portables sales suffered partly due to its game library. While there were a few notable games, it didn’t get the same first-party support that Sony showed its home video game consoles.\nThis lack of first-party support hurt Sony when going up against the DS, which had a constant stream of strong first-party games.",

            "description": "Sega or also known as <strong>Se</strong>rvice <strong>Ga</strong>mes is a Japanese video game publisher, developer and hardware company that has their headquarters located in Tokyo, Japan.\nFounded back in 1940 the company use to develop and distribute coin operated games, jukeboxes and slot machines. After a few years of growth they started importing these machines to American military bases within Japan.\nAs they continued to grow they went from being an importer to a manufacturer and started to release some more arcade games. In 1979 as arcade gaming was booming Sega’s revenues shot to over 100 million.\nIn 1982 Sega’s revenues passed the $214 million mark and released their first 3D game for the market. It was not long after this that there was a video gaming crash that sent Sega’s revenue back down to $136 million. Not long after this Sega was purchased for $38 million by a group of investors led by Rosen, Robert Deith and Hayao Nakayama.\nThroughout 1989 to 2001 Sega started their console campaign. These shared both successes and failures to the eventual pull out of the console market in 2001. During this time Nakayama stepped down as chairman and Isao Okawa took over.\nAs of 2002 Sega had have 5 years of net loses had started to struggle with the Okawa giving the company $700 million in a private donation before his death in 2001.\nThe company suffered many setbacks with deals and mergers all falling through as they tried to pick themselves back up. In 2003 Sammy had bought out the outstanding 22% amount of shares that CSK had left. This put the Sammy Chairman Hajime Satomi as the CEO of Sega. After this things started taking a turn with Sammy buying a controlling share of the company in 2004 at a cost of $1.1 billion.\nSega has since been able to turn a profit releasing many successful franchises such as Sonic for all the consoles. The company is now making about $513 million in profit and over 4.9 billion in revenue.",

            "description": "Microsoft has been involved with the gaming industry for quite some time. Before their push to the game console market, Microsoft published several popular game series such as Age of Empires, Links, and Microsoft Flight Simulator.\nThey made a huge leap into the game console market on November 15th, 2001, with the release of the original Xbox.\nSince their original console, Microsoft has become a dominant force in the gaming industry. They have quickly grown to be one of the largest game publishers in the world.\n<h2 class=\"border-bottom\"><span class=\"console_icons xbox_icon align-middle\"></span> Xbox</h2>\nWith the Xbox, Microsoft brought a lot of their expertise with computers to the console market.\nThe Xbox was the first game console to feature a built-in hard disk. This new feature allowed people to save game data directly to the console and not having to rely on separate memory disks.\nA year into its release Microsoft made another big move with the release of Xbox Live. Xbox Live serves as a way of connecting players together.\nThe Xbox saw the release of a few stellar hits. The most notable of these is both the Halo and Fable series.\nEven though the Xbox didn’t sell as well as its main competitor, the PlayStation 2, it proved Microsoft was taking the game console market seriously and still managed to beat Nintendo’s GameCube in unit sales.\nIn terms of emulation, the Xbox has proven to be incredibly difficult. This difficulty may be in part due to the complexity of the CPU and GPU featured in the hardware.\n<h2 class=\"border-bottom\"><span class=\"console_icons xbox_360_icon align-middle\"></span> Xbox 360</h2>\nIn 2005, Microsoft released there second console, the Xbox 360.\nThe Xbox 360 featured Xbox Live as a core component of the console.\nThe console proved quite trying for Microsoft thanks to various hardware issues with the original hardware revision. The “<strong>red ring of death</strong>” became a common occurrence due to the console overheating from a poorly designed heatsink.\nWhile Microsoft offered to fix any console that was afflicted with the issue, it did severely damage their reputation in the console industry.\nDespite the issues that Microsoft faced with the Xbox 360, they still stuck by it and released several iterations to fix the problem.\nDuring the lifespan of the Xbox 360, Microsoft introduced a new piece of technology. This piece of technology was called “Kinect”. Kinect allowed people to interact with games using their bodies.\nThe Kinect ended up selling insanely well and proved to be a huge commercial success for the company. This success may have been partly to blame for the Xbox One’s failures.\nThere have been recent attempts to emulate the Xbox 360 that has proved fruitful, mainly by the <a href=\"https://emulationking.com/xenia/\">Xenia team</a>.\n<h2 class=\"border-bottom\"><span class=\"console_icons xbox_one_icon align-middle\"></span> Xbox One</h2>\nIn 2013 Microsoft released its third video game console, the Xbox One. The original vision of the Xbox One was for it to be an entertainment hub for everything. It would play media, games, tv and everything else.\nTrying to do so much with the console, however, just confused the companies overall message. Many people felt like Microsoft was abandoning the games market to focus on things like TV shows rather than making a great game.\nIn addition to this, the original release of the Xbox One came with the Kinect sensor. The Kinect was not an optional extra and was required to be plugged in regardless of whether you were using it or not. Not only was the Kinect forced, but it also severely hindered the Xbox Ones already lacking system specifications.\nThis series of blunders led to several leads leaving the games division. Microsoft eventually appointed a new president for the gaming division, Phil Spencer.\nPhil Spencer focused the Xbox division back to gaming and made several sweeping changes such as dropping Kinect.\nOne of the most impressive improvements brought to the Xbox One under Phil’s leadership was the backward compatibility. The Xbox One can play numerous Xbox and Xbox 360 games. Some games can even be played at higher resolutions than originally intended.\nThe fact that both the Xbox and Xbox 360 have barely been emulated on the PC shows how big of a feat that would have been to pull off, especially with zero performance degradation.\nSo far, there have been no solid attempts to emulate the Xbox One on the PC.\n<h2 class=\"border-bottom\">Xbox Series X</h2>\nThe next game console from Microsoft is set to be released in 2020 with the name “Xbox Series X”. This console will feature full-backward compatibility with the Xbox One as well as other currently unannounced features.\nWe will update this section when we find out more about the console.",

This prompted the company to split where the arcade division was turned in Atari Games. The consumer electronics division was sold to Jack Termiel’s Tramel Technology which then renamed themselves to Atari Corporation.\nIn 1996 The Atari cooperation was reverse merged with the hard drive disk manufacture J Storage becoming a division within the company.\nLater in 1998 Hasbro bought out the entire of Atari Corporation from JTS and created a new subsidiary known as Atari Interactive.\n\nAfter Infogrames Entertainment (IESA) bought out Hasbro Interactive in 2001 they eventually settled on the name Atari Inc and is still known under that name today.",

Launching with a critical hit like Breath of the Wild gave the Switch the popularity boost that the Wii U never quite achieved.\nNintendo followed up the release of the Switch with several other hits such as Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Splatoon 2, and Super Mario Oddysee. The console has also had fantastic support from 3rd party developers, with a slew of well-optimized ports of high-profile games such as Skyrim.\nThe Nintendo Switch has a couple of unique features. First is the ability for the Switch to be used as both a handheld console and a video game console. This works by using a simple dock that connects to your tv.\nOne thing to note is that when the Switch in handheld mode, its performance is slightly limited to try to preserve battery life.  This means most games will have their resolutions reduced to 720p.\nThe other is the ability of the controllers to also act as motion controllers. However, this ability is not available on the “Lite” version of the Switch.\nThe Nintendo Switch Lite is a handheld only version of the console with non-detachable controllers. It can run any game that has compatibility for the Switches handheld mode.\nSwitch emulation has made an astonishing amount of progress in just a few short years thanks to the effort of the Yuzu Emulator team. The emulator is able to emulate a large amount of the Switch’s library already successfully.\nConsidering the time it took for the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U to be successfully emulated, the progress in developing an emulator for the Nintendo Switch has been surprisingly fast.",

The console was released worldwide in 2012 but sadly lacked the massive amount of hype and excitement that its predecessor had created, this was not helped by a fairly lacking library of launch day games.\nThe Wii U was a primary competitor to Microsoft’s Xbox One, and Sony’s PlayStation 4, sadly though despite those consoles releasing nearly a year after the Wii U’s release, the Wii U just couldn’t make the same level of sales, its hard to say whether this was due to a poor library of games or poor marketing, the name Wii U may of created confusion with some consumers due to its similarities with the Wii name.\nWii U emulation seemed to be something that was never going to happen for a period of time, over the years there was a few attempts here and there that attempted to emulate it but most of those projects were short lived or ran into problems due to the sheer lack of documentation on the inner working on the Wii U.\nIt was not until October 2015 when there was a big breakthrough in emulation, and a massive surprise to the emulation community and that was with the first release of Cemu. Cemu was the first Nintendo Wii U Emulator that started showing real promise. Despite Cemu being closed source there is now another promising emulator that is making progress, namely the open source Decaf emulator project.\nThe biggest hindrance to the Wii U is down to its poor library of games, not only was Nintendo incredibly slow in bringing their own superb IP’s to the console, many 3rd party companies abandoned the console altogether leaving it with a void of games despite some superb surprises like Bayonetta 2.",

            "description": "The Nintendo 3DS was developed by Nintendo as a successor to the original Nintendo DS. While the design is very much familiar the underlying hardware is completely different. It features a more powerful CPU and GPU allowing the device to handle more complex scenes and also the new 3D functionality of the top screen.\nEmulation of the Nintendo 3DS seemed to be something that was never going to end up happening, after several failed attempts and a seemingly lack of real interest from developers there was a sudden surprise release of 3DS Emulator, Citra. Citra came out of nowhere and proved that 3DS Emulation could be done, and as years have gone, shown that it can be done fast and successfully. There was two other attempts but both of those ceased development before showing the amount of progress Citra did, those 3DS emulators being Tron 3DS and 3dmoo. In a way its a good thing as development now appears to be solely focused around Citra, allowing it the best chance to fully emulate the 3DS.\nAs Nintendo has done with the vast majority of its devices. They have introduced a new different feature to the handheld market, and not one people would of expected. This feature is that the top screen acts as a 3D display. This display is designed in a way so the user does not require 3D glasses to see the 3D effect. Though this has some draw backs in its original iteration. That being that if the screen was not looked at directly and at the right angle the 3D effect wouldn’t work properly and make the screen appear blurry. However this is a problem that was solved with Nintendo’s latest 3Ds iteration marketed as “New Nintendo 3DS”.\nThe console has faced two different iterations of its design to date. The first of these being the Nintendo 2DS. This took away the consoles clam shell design and made it a more flat design. It also removed a key feature of the Nintendo 3DS and that is the 3D screen, despite this the actual hardware inside the console remains relatively the same. It is believed that this iteration was aimed at younger children due to a couple of reasons. The first is the lack of a hinge to be damaged, and the second being the lack of the 3D, as it was believed it could put strain on younger eyes.",

This opened up the console to a variety of different games that weren’t present on its competitors systems.\nThe console originally also had two extra functions, one that is not present in the end production model, and one other that has been taken offline.\nThe first of these is the ability to play GameCube games on the Nintendo Wii, this allowed the console to remain fully backwards compatible with all GameCube games as long as you had a GameCube controller.  However this feature was removed for the two later and final versions of the Nintendo Wii, these being the Wii Family Edition and the Wii Mini.\nThe second feature that is no longer present in all versions of the console is its online capabilities and also its WiiConnect24 function that allowed the console to receive updates and messages while its in standby. These were both taken offline by Nintendo, meaning all multiplayer functions of games can no longer be used. Despite these two features being removed the Wii Shop Channel still functions.",

            "description": "The Nintendo DS was Nintendo’s successor to the Game Boy Advance. It introduced two very stand out unique features to the handheld market. While the Nintendo DS did make use of the Game Boy Advance’s SP clamshell design, the way it utilized it much differently.\n\nThe biggest and most obvious of these unique features is the inclusion of two LCD screens that work in tandem, the bottom screen also acts as a touch device allowing interaction with the images on screen. Something, that at the time was quite unusual and different to the standardized single screen and buttons.\nAnother feature the Nintendo DS was the addition of a microphone, this was another different feature games could tap into to use to offer unique game play elements, such as blowing smoke off the screen.\n\nThe other most noticeable feature is its Wi-FI ability that allows it to connect to other Nintendo DS’s, it also had online play through the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection service. However sadly that service was  shut down in 2014 making online useless for all games designed for the Nintendo DS. This forces people to the 3DS if they want to enjoy games with online abilities.\nThe Nintendo DS would end up seeing three separate reiterations of its look and hardware, this is not include the extra large screen versions that were also relate for the DSi version. The first iteration was  the Nintendo DS Lite, this retained all the features of the original fat DS but however was a lot slimmer, and included better screens. There was also slight improvement to the hardware inside the console, however this was mainly battery saving changes then performance increases. The DS Lite also retains the backwards compatibility with Game Boy Advance games  that the original Nintendo DS allowed.\nAfter the Nintendo DS Lite, Nintendo introduced the DSi. This made a few more changes to the formula, adding a camera to the console, improved Wi-Fi and again better screens. Alongside this it also came with iterations that featured a much larger screen. The underling hardware was also improved which meant there were a few games that were made for the DSi specifically. However most developers chose to make sure the game worked on all three iterations, not utilizing the improvements. Despite all these improvements the Nintendo DSi removed the backwards compatibility for Game Boy Advance games that the fat DS and DS Lite had.",

            "description": "The Nintendo Gamecube marked Nintendo’s 5th entry into the home Video game console market. It was Nintendo’s first move into using optical media as its primary storage. However instead of using the standard full-sized disc’s, Nintendo chose to use miniDVD, excluding the console from being able to play standard DVD’s or audio CD’s due to the smaller size. This made it lack a feature its two competitors of the time, the Xbox and the Playstation 2, and that is simply to also be able to act as a DVD player. While a simple feature, it did add an extra element to a consumers decision on what console to buy, especially during a period where DVD players were costly.\nThe system had the ability to expand its hardware functionality via a port on the bottom of the console. This would only ever end up being used for the consoles Broardband Adapter which gave the console its network functionality, and also the Game Boy Player which allowed Game Boy games to be played on the TV with a GameCube controller.\nWhile the GameCube was praised for having an extensive library of high-quality games, the console failed to gain the sales that its main competitors did. At the end of its lifetime, the Game Cube managed to make 21.74 million sales, falling short by 3 million sales to Microsofts newcomer, the Xbox. However both fell painfully short of the Playstation 2’s 155 million sales.\nDespite the GameCube’s shortfall in sales, it still left a legacy thanks to its high quality games.",

The hand held console managed to hold on to Nintendo’s reign as being the top hand held console seller. This is in part due to the Game Boy Advance selling over 81.51 million units.\nMuch like its predecessor, the Game Boy Advance retained backwards compatibility support, this allowed the console to support both Game Boy Color and Game Boy games. This gave the Game Boy Advance a superb library of high quality and well made games right off the bat. Making it an easy choice for those who have yet to buy a hand held or are thinking of replacing their Game Boy Colour they can still retain their library of games.\nThe Game Boy Advance saw two redesigns, the first of these was the Game Boy Advance SP. This saw the console move to using the clamshell design that is now present in the Nintendo DS. It also introduced a backlight to the consoles design allowing it to be played much better under different lighting conditions and also allow the colours to appear more vibrant.\nThe second of these was the Game Boy Micro. This was essentially a much smaller version of the Game Boy Advance. It however also meant that it lacked a major feature of the Game Boy Advance. This being its backwards compatibility. It however still had some of the feature improvements that the SP introduced such as the backlight.\nThe Game Boy Advance truly set Nintendo as the company to beat in the handheld console market, and has managed to remain king of the market ever since.",

Thanks to largely having the same hardware, this enabled the Game Boy Color to remain backwards compatible with older games.\nThis backwards compatibility was a huge advantage when coming up against its competitors as it allowed the handheld to inherit a large game library right off the bat and not rely completely on a couple of games to generate sales.\nThe Game Boy Color proved to be a huge success, going on to sell over 118.59 million units.

            "description": "The Nintendo 64 (Often abbreviated to N64) is Nintendo’s third attempt at a video game console. It was the world’s true first 64-bit CPU console.\nThe N64 saw the release of many games that are touted as being some of the best of all time. These games range from much raved Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of time to the game touted with revolutionizing the FPS genre GoldenEye 007.\nGraphically the Nintendo 64 was the more powerful of the 5th generation consoles, its boost in power was helped in that it came in at the end of the 5th generation of consoles.\nThe N64’s graphics chip was capable of trilinear filtering, among other more advanced 3D techniques. However, the true power of the N64 console was inhibited by the smaller storage size of the ROM cartridges.\nThe smaller size made developers have to reduce the number of textures used and use other methods such as Gouraud shading or extremely simple textures.\nEmulation wise the N64 is still to be perfected. While the vast majority of games are playable, there are still a few that are completely unplayable. Most problems with N64 emulation and its compatibility doesn’t come from its CPU but from its GPU.\nThe GPU uses methods that are rather complicated to successfully emulate on modern GPU’s, while a modern GPU is far more powerful we simply don’t have the same access to it as developers on the original N64 would have to its GPU.\nIt is also not helped that there is a lack of documentation on the way the GPU operates for specific games. One of the most significant of these being Star Wars Rogue Squadron.\nBest compatibility emulator wise is Project 64. It offers full and fast support for the vast majority of games, video plugin wise, Glide64 is the go-to for best emulation of the GPU side. However, it does sacrifice speed.",

The console was such a commercial failure that it never made it out of Japan and North America.\nOne of the Virtual Boy’s worse points was that its screen was only capable of monochrome colors destroying the immersion of the system. Another problem users found was the lack of games that truly made use of its “3D” features with most of them just using the 3D functionality as a gimmick while still functioning like a 2D game would.",

The NES is strongly associated with the revitalization of the US video game industry after the crash of the industry in 1983.\nNintendo used the NES to bring to life some of what are they most popular game series to date, these being Super Mario Bros, The Legend of Zelda and Metroid. It also so the birth of Capcom’s Mega Man franchise, Konami’s Castlevania franchise, Square’s(Now Square Enix) Final Fantasy franchise and Enix’s(Now Square Enix) Dragon Quest franchise. All of these franchises are still highly popular and still exist today.\nWhile Nintendo’s NES brought to life some of the greatest game franchises it also gave console manufactures a new outlook in their relationship with third-party software developers by restricting developers from publishing software without licensed approval from the manufacturer. This led to the consoles having much more high quality software titles, and in turn better public outlook on the console.\nWhile the console is no longer being manufactured, the console has been emulated to the point where almost all hardware functionality has been replicated on the computer, with some emulators such as Nestopia providing cycle accurate emulation of the original hardware, meaning what is shown on screen should be exactly what the original console would of produced.",

Both of these technologies were only released in 2020, meaning that they were cutting edge at the time of the release.\nWhere Sony has made their most significant changes is their new PS5 DualSense controller. On the outside, it features a more refined shape with better button placements.\nOn the inside of the controller is where the real magic occurs. Thanks to the introduction of new haptic technology, the rumble has way more fidelity.\nAdditionally, the triggers have been reworked so that they can have a feel of tension as you press them. Games can configure these triggers so that they have different reactions depending on the task. For example, when pulling back a bow, you can feel the tension increase as you pull the trigger.\nOut of all the changes introduced by the new hardware, the controller is what helps set the console apart from previous generations.\nAt this stage there is <strong>no currently successful emulation projects for the PlayStation 5</strong>. Be wary of any projects claiming that they can emulate any part of the PS5 as it is a relatively new piece of hardware.\nWe will update this page and provide links to emulators as projects manage to get off the ground.",

            "description": "The PlayStation Vita was Sony’s second attempt at building a handheld video game console. It was released in 2011 during the eighth generation of video game consoles, going up against the Nintendo 3DS. \nThe PS Vita boasted modest specs for the time. The first iteration even boasted an OLED screen. It also featured complete backwards compatibility for all PlayStation Portable games.\nYou could even use the PS Vita as a remote play device for your PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3. Remote play allowed you to play games without needing to use a TV.\nWhile the PS Vita has built up quite a loyal fanbase that has modified the device for their own uses, overall, the console was a commercial failure. It failed to get near the same amount of sales as its competitor with the estimated final sales sitting at about 16 million units worldwide.\nAnalysts primarily point to this failure being of Sony’s own making. During the PS Vita’s lifetime, there were barely any games produced by Sony for the device. Additionally, due to Sony’s lack of support, there was never any real big push from 3rd party studios to support the device.\nThe PS Vita is a popular device for running emulated games, thanks to the broader community’s great work. People choose it as a suitable handheld emulation device thanks to its decent power, built-in support for PSP and PlayStation 1 games, and overall design.\nHowever, emulation of the PlayStation Vita has had slow progress, primarily due to programmers’ lack of interest. There is currently only one actively developed emulator that has managed to produce results.\nThat PS Vita emulator being Vita3k. This emulator is still highly experimental and can only play a few commercial games.",

It competed against Microsoft’s Xbox 360 and Nintendo’s Wii in what was a bitterly fought battle between the 3 companies, and a battle that was thought right up to the end of the seventh generation of video game consoles.\nThe PS3 started slowly with both the Nintendo Wii and the Xbox 360 launching a year before the PS3, while this hurt it in the short time it gave more will to Sony to push there console hard. Leading to the console having some of the greatest video games of all time, such as the excellent Metal Gear Solid IV, the Uncharted series, and The Last of Us, this is among a plethora of other highly successful and highly regarded games.\nHowever the delayed launch was not the only negative point to the PS3, while it included much more powerful GPU and CPU then its two competitors, there was a significant flaw with the hardware. That being it was incredibly hard to program for with Sony choosing to make use of the powerful but complex Cell processors. This made it difficult for companies to develop for the console especially near the start of the generation as most companies didn’t have the chance to work out the best way to utilize the processor.\nThis cell processor is also what makes emulating the PS3 extremely difficult, many people thought it would make emulation of the PS3 unachievable. However these doubts were put to rest when PS3 Emulator RPCS3 was released by DH & Hykem, it proved that emulation of the complicated Cell architecture could be achieved. This was an extremely remarkable and impressive achievement. Over 5 years on from its initial release, RPCS3 is now even managing to emulate actual commercial games and get in game, and even be playable at some decent speeds.",

The first to try and tackle it was the PSP Emulator, PSPE. While PSPE could never actually emulate a commercial PSP game, it did prove that PSP emulation could be done. This was followed by numerous other emulators. The most modern PSP Emulator is PPSSPP, which has proven itself to be able to emulate basically all PSP games faithfully while offering numerous extra features so the games can be rendered in HD. PSP Emulation is regarded as now being fairly complete, large in thanks to the efforts of the PPSSPP team.\nThe PSP sported high end hardware for its time, boasting a more powerful processor and GPU then its competitor the Nintendo DS. It also featured an assortment of different features such as a tv tuner, media player and various other multimedia capabilities. The device was also meant to sport the capability to be able to connect directly the the PlayStation 3 as well.\nThe PSP had a weird way of storing its games, unlike Nintendo’s hand-held consoles and the various others who tried to beat Nintendo over the years, Sony chose to make use of a optical disc format, bucking the trend of using cartridges for games.

It competed against Sega’s final console entry, the SEGA Dreamcast, Nintendo’s GameCube and Microsoft Xbox.\nA key feature to the PlayStation 2 was its ability to be fully backward compatible with the PlayStation 1 (PSX) games. This means a user who chose to buy the new console did not have to ditch there whole games library or retain the older console. This was in stark contrast to Sony’s competitors at the time, as a new console often meant all your games were rendered useless. The PS2 also managed to retain support for the previous generations’ Dualshock controllers.\nEmulation of the PS2 has been somewhat successful, largely in thanks to the PCSX2 emulation project. PCSX2 was originally started by the development team, who made the PlayStation 1 (PSX) Emulator, PCSX.\nPCSX2 proved that the emulation of the PS2 could be achieved.

It was the PlayStations and Sony’s jump start into becoming one of the most formidable opponents in the gaming world.\nThe PlayStation’s biggest competitors during the fifth generation of video game consoles was the Nintendo 64 and the Sega Saturn. Despite going up against incredibly stiff competition with video game giants Nintendo and Sega dominating the market, the PlayStation managed to overcome both of them, overtaking that of the Nintendo 64 and leaving the Sega Saturn in distant third place. One of the biggest advantages of the PlayStation was that it relied on discs, though cartridges were an awful lot faster and didn’t suffer as many durability issues, they just didn’t have the same storage space that a CD could provide. CD’s were an awful lot cheaper to produce, something that appealed heavily to publishers as there wasn’t as significant of a risk to produce large quantities of a game.\nPlayStation (PSX) emulation is fairly complete, with the vast majority of games able to run flawlessly with no major issues, the focus of most PSX emulators have now turned to focus on increasing the accuracy and speed of their emulation over trying to increase compatibility. This is alongside increasing features such as being able to successfully render PSX games at higher internal resolutions. There is several great PlayStation emulators, though most are plugin based, ePXSE, PCSX-R are both highly capable emulators.",

It is also the final console that Sega released with no successors afterwards.\nAfter the setback Sega had with the Saturn system such as high production costs and very complex hardware they decided to take a different approach. The outcome of this decision was a console that was designed to be much more intelligent with subsystems working in parallel.\nThe console was originally very successful as the U.S launch was highly backed by a large marketing campaign but interest in the console rapidly declined once Sony started to build the hype for their upcoming console.\nThere were many factors to why Sega exited the console market but the Dreamcast was one of the leading issues with failing to meet sales expectations and the rise in tough competition such as the Playstation 2, Xbox and Nintendo’s latest console.\nEven though it had such as short lifespan and very limited support the console was still praised as being ahead of its time.\nThere were some pretty awesome games that were released for the Sega Dreamcast just to name a few Crazy Taxi, Shenmue, Jet Set Radio and as well of some great high quality ports from the Naomi arcade system board.",

It was released on November 22, 1994 in Japan, May 11 1995 in North American and July 8, 1995 in Europe. It is the successor the successful Sega Genesis.\nThe North American launch was a surprise launch that caught many of the retailers by surprise as only a few retailers had been told about this. As a result few retailers refused to stock any of Sega’s products. The console boasted a dual-CPU setup with a total of eight processors. The games also were in a CD-ROM format.\nThe Saturn’s game library consisted mostly of the Arcade ports that included games such as Daytona USA, Last Bronx, Die Hard Arcade and many more. In 1998 surprisingly the system had more games than its competitor the Nintendo 64. The Saturn faced many problems in the American marketplace after selling well in Japan. The console was released 4 months prior and faced very shaky sales and to top it off the release of the Nintendo 64 in 1996 basically was the final nail in the coffin, with the SEGA Saturn being discontinued in 1998. The Sega Saturn sold a total of only 9.5 million units worldwide and was considered a commercial failure.\nAs there was a decline in the industry the failure of the Sega Saturn put a lot of financial strain onto the company. This caused departures within the company and for the discontinuation of the system leaving the Western Market without any Sega games for over a year.",

By the time the Sega Genesis was discontinued it had sold an estimated 40 million units.\nThe Sega Genesis still maintains a strong fan base with people collecting the old consoles and games.

These cards retailed at lower prices than cartridges but had a drawback of having less memory then a cartridge. The Sega cards were eventually dropped because their very small memory limit. (Only 256 Kbit)\nThe system had superior hardware when it was compared to NES containing twice as much memory. The CPU also ran at a much faster pace but this wasn’t enough to stop the NES and its strong franchise lines from outdoing them in sales.There was a few accessories developed for the system such as 3D glasses and a light gun both being designed to work with a range of specially developed games.\nThe console faced strong competition from Nintendo with the Sega Master System only selling about 10-13 million units over its life time which is far less than the NES that sold over 62 million.\n\nThe game library was criticised of being too small and needed to be more substantial. The Master System did feature the Sega’s flagship character at the time (The Alex Kidd franchise). Other games such as Street Fighter II and Dynamite Headdy were also released for the system.",

            "description": "The Xbox Series S/X made up a part of Microsoft’s ninth generation of video game consoles and was released at the end of 2020. These consoles are the successor to the Xbox One and represent the companies fourth attempt at building its own video game console.\nLike the PlayStation 5, the Xbox Series console sported some of the latest processing technologies from AMD. These processing technologies are AMD’s Zen 2 CPU architecture and their RDNA 2 GPU architecture.\nThe use of these architectures allows the Xbox’s processor to match that of what was a relatively high-end computer at the time of release.\nValue-wise this put the Xbox Series console in an excellent position. They boasted pretty high-end CPU and GPU performance at a fraction of what it would cost to build a PC of the same capabilities.\nWhen marketing their latest Xbox consoles Microsoft focused a lot on their backward compatibility capabilities.\nThe Xbox Series consoles are fully backward compatible with the Xbox One. They even support a large number of games from the Xbox 360 and the original Xbox.\nOn the hardware side, the Xbox Series consoles set out to achieve a few things. The first was to improve the storage speed of the device significantly. Game consoles for years have relied on slow hard drives. The Xbox Series made the jump to an NVMe drive. These drives are incredibly fast, allowing the console to load data almost instantly.\nThese gave rise to features such as Xbox’s Quick Resume. This feature stored the game’s current game state on the NVMe drive to quickly load back into memory.\nAs the Xbox Series consoles are relatively new, there have been no successful attempts at emulating the video game console. Be careful if you see any website claiming they have a fully working Xbox Series emulator.\nWe will update this page once there is progress on developing an emulator of the Xbox Series.",

This is can be attributed to a very poor marketing effort that left consumers confused.\nThe announcement conference of the Xbox One featured a large segment dedicated to non gaming features, and then the time that was left focused on policies that were never explained properly. Such as the apparent “always-online” feature, and the original policy of being unable to trade in games, replacing the normal console system with a system much like the extremely popular PC Gaming platform, Steam.\nThe next few weeks after the Xbox One’s announcement there was a few attempts to try and clarify there policies but those attempts just ended up throwing fuel on the fire and confusing the consumers even further. Eventually the two key policies of the console ended up being rolled back for the more traditional style. But it ended up with two high level Microsoft employees having to stand down, the most notable of these being the head of Xbox, Don Mattrick. Ultimately the Xbox One never recovered from the disaster that it was the announcement, Sony utilized the mess up to promote there console and appear to be the good guys helping them gain a majority early on in the consoles life.\nEmulation of the Xbox One is nothing but a pipe dream at this moment, there is no current effort to try and emulate the console, and there does not currently appear to be any real interest in a Xbox One emulator. Please note if you do find any supposed Xbox One emulators on the internet, steer clear of them as they are more then likely loaded with adware.\nIt is currently to difficult to find out how well the Xbox One is doing as Microsoft chose to cease disclosing the Xbox One Sold unit numbers.\n<div class=\"et_pb_row et_pb_row_2 et_pb_row_fullwidth\">\n<div class=\"et_pb_column et_pb_column_4_4 et_pb_column_2 et_pb_css_mix_blend_mode_passthrough et-last-child\">\n<div class=\"et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_3 et_pb_bg_layout_light et_pb_text_align_left\">\n<div class=\"et_pb_text_inner\">\n<h2>Xbox One Emulators</h2>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_4 et_pb_bg_layout_light et_pb_text_align_left\">\n<div class=\"et_pb_text_inner\">\nThere is currently <strong>no</strong> Xbox One emulator in development, or any Xbox One emulator released at all.\n\nPlease note that if you find any on the internet at this time, it is likely a <strong>fake, </strong>even more so if it claims to actually be able to one any games fully.\nPlease steer clear of any Xbox One Emulators.

            "description": "The Xbox 360 was Microsoft’s entry into the seventh generation of video game consoles, It went up against two very impressive showing, that being Sony’s PlayStation 3, and the extremely successful Nintendo Wii. The Xbox 360 managed to sell over 84 million units, an impressive feat despite suffering some serious setbacks. Initial versions of the Xbox 360 suffered from a severe hardware failure, often refereed to as the “Red Ring of Death”. This was caused by a poor heat sink and bracket that would over time cause the processor to bend and be lifted from the main board.\nEmulation of the Xbox 360 seemed like a very far fetched idea up considering the sheer difficulty developers had trying to emulate the original Xbox. There is one incredibly promising Xbox 360 emulator that has surfaced, and that is the surprising Xenia. it has already managed to get in game in a variety of different games and is already showing great promise that it will manage to successfully emulate the system.\nThe Xbox 360 was an impressive showing from Microsoft, boasting a much improved online service, something that ended up becoming a core pillar of the device thanks to its sheer success in the previous generation of consoles. The Xbox 360 also boasted a rather robust set of media center abilities, however unlike the PlayStation 3, Microsoft made the decision to only include a DVD drive. While Microsoft eventually brought out an addon that implemented the HD DVD, it ended up a failed effort as the HD DVD ultimately failed after Blu-ray gained significant support.\nUltimately the Xbox 360 was a very successful video game console, while not the top selling seventh generation video game console, it did bring with it some of the most memorable games of the generation. One of the most notable game series of those is the Gears of War series, which has now become a pillar of Xbox gaming alongside the fantastic open world racing game, Forza Horizon and the stellar Forza Motorsport series.",

            "description": "The Xbox was Microsfts first real foray into  Video Game Console development, while they have done gaming on the PC for many years prior, they had never touched console development till the Xbox’s release. It came in the sixth generation of video game consoles, going up against the Nintendo GameCube, the SEGA Dreamcast and the Sony PS2.\nThe Xbox was different to all of the consoles of its time, Instead of utilizing highly customized pieces of hardware like the Dreamcast and PlayStation 2 did, the Xbox instead used hardware that was much more familiar to them. That being they utilized a PC style system and architecture for there console, bringing in the in-built hard drive to store save games directly to the console, removing the need to purchase memory cards.\nEmulation of the Xbox so far has not managed to get very far, despite a couple of attempts emulation has basically never gotten past managing to get in-game in a couple of games. Performance is not to great in the emulators either. The difficulty of Xbox Emulation is likely due to how much in common it has with the PC Architecture and the sheer lack of any real documentation on how everything works. There is currently only one real Xbox emulator project that is making ground, and that is the XQEMU project.\nIt also brought with it an Ethernet port, and was the first video game console to bring together a proper online gaming community with there console thanks to the introduction of Xbox Live. Xbox Live didn’t just let you play games with other people, it also let you add friends to a buddy list and interact with them. Xbox’s network prowess was helped by there better and more reliable services coupled alongside the fantastic online gameplay of Halo 2.\nUltimately the Xbox fared extremely well for there first video game console, coming distant second to the PlayStation 2. Ending with over 24 million units sold, it proved more popular then Nintendo’s GameCube and eclipsed that of the SEGA Dreamcast.",

The console had only sold about 250 thousand.\nThe Jaguar faced many problems that contributed to its failure such as extensive delays in development of the software for the console and also the introduction of products into the market by both Sega and Sony in 1995.\nThe Atari Jaguar had quite a few different accessories that could add functionality to the console. Just to name a few there was the cd add-on, memory track, team tap and many more.\nThere was a total of 82 games released for the console 67 were for the console itself and the other 15 were for the CD add-on.

Lifetime sales of the Lynx totalled out to be about 7 million units when combined with the game gear. The Gameboy had sold 16 million units by the same time.\nThe handheld console received good praise by the critics at the time with one critic claiming that it “throws the Gameboy into the prehistoric age” citing the built-in object scaling capabilities and the strong multiplayer system gave it a huge advantage over the Gameboy.",

Also due to the strong feedback Atari received regarding not being able to play previous games on the 5200 they made sure this console was able to play almost all the games from the 2600.\nAlso as growing concerns from the community that a home PC was a better investment than a console the system was designed to be fully fledged home computer. You were able to plug in a keyboard and other peripherals such as disk drives and printers.\nThe console even though didn’t do nearly as well as the NES, but was still profitable for Atari, with it managing to sell over 3.8 million units worldwide. On January 1<sup>st</sup> 1992 Atari announced that the production of the Atari 7800 will end only being able to capture 12% while its rival Nintendo controlled 80%",
