            "description": "Nintendo is a consumer electric company based in Japan. While they are best known for there hit video gaming consoles such as the Super Nintendo, Nintendo 64, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS, and the Nintendo Wii. Nintendo’s roots date back to 1889 where it originally produced handmade playing cards.\nIt wasn’t till 1974 that Nintendo finally made a foray into Video Games and the home video console market. Their first venture was obtaining the redistribution rights for the Magnavox Odyssey video game console in Japan, it would be another three years before Nintendo would finally begin manufacturing their own hardware. There first attempt was the Colour TV-Game, while 6 versions were released they were all variations of the same game, Light Tennis.\nNintendo’s  success in the games industry however did not come till the 1980 with the launch of their first handheld video game console, the Game & Watch. These only featured one specific game that was tied to the hardware unlike Nintendo’s future handhelds that implemented to swap in and out cartridges. The next 20 years would see Nintendo further entrench themselves as a company to watch out for in the games industry with loveable franchises and hugely successful consoles.\nOver the 20 years consumers would see the release of several consoles that are firmly entrenched as a part of gaming history. 1985 saw the release of the  Famicon which was also known as the Nintendo Entertainment System(NES). The Famicon was released alongside ports of Nintendo’s arcade games. They also introduced the practice of bundling games helping make Super Mario Bros as one of the best selling video games of all time.\n1989 was the year for the Game Boy to take the stage. The handheld console was born from merging the idea of the Game & Watch with the NES’s ability to interchange cartridges.The Game Boy managed to kick start Nintendo’s dominance over the handheld console market, a dominance that has managed to last many years to come. The success was again partly thanks to Nintendo’s bundling strategies, with the Game Boy’s bundling of 3rd party game Tetris being an instant success.",

            "description": "Sony Corporation is a company that focusses on professional electronics, gaming, entertainment, and even financial service. Even though Sony was founded back in 1946, the company wouldn’t break into the gaming world for another 49 years.\nDespite its late start in the gaming industry, Sony has continually proven itself to be a dominant force in the industry.\n<h2 class=\"border-bottom\"><span class=\"console_icons ps1_icon align-middle\"></span> PlayStation 1</h2>\nOn the 3rd of December, 1994 in Japan, Sony made a move into the gaming market with the release of its very first gaming console, the PlayStation 1 (Commonly referred to as the PS1, PS, and PSX).\nThe PlayStation proved to be both a critical and commercial success and paved Sony’s way to becoming one of the most dominant forces in the gaming industry. Sony is regarded as the largest game console business and one of the largest game publishers in the world.\nThe original PlayStation saw the release of numerous critically acclaimed games, such as the release of Gran Turismo, Crash Bandicoot, Final Fantasy VII, Metal Gear Solid, and much more.\nThis wealth of games helped Sony position themselves in the  gaming market as a force to be reckoned with.\n<h2 class=\"border-bottom\"><span class=\"console_icons ps2_icon align-middle\"></span> PlayStation 2</h2>\nWith the release of the PlayStation 2 in the year 2000, Sony successfully solidified its dominance in the gaming market with the PS2 selling over 155 million units during its lifespan.\nThe console was so successful that Sony kept its production running well into the life span of the PlayStation 3 with the production ending in 2013.\nThe PS2’s growth was helped by the continual release of high-quality games such as God Of War, Ratched & Clank, Kingdom Hearts, and many more.\n<h2 class=\"border-bottom\"><span class=\"console_icons PS3_icon align-middle\"></span> PlayStation 3</h2>\nSix years later, Sony released the PlayStation 3 as its successor to the widely successful PS2. The PS3 had a slow start due to it releasing later than its competitors and sporting a higher price tag.\nHowever, the PS3 still rallied to be a commercially successful release, selling over 87 million units during its lifespan.\nThis success was spurred on by a release of substantial new exclusive hits such as Metal Gear Solid 4, Little Big Planet, Killzone 2, the Uncharted series, The Last of Us, and many more.\n<h2 class=\"border-bottom\"><span class=\"console_icons ps4_icon align-middle\"></span> PlayStation 4</h2>\nSony’s current latest offering is the PlayStation 4. Released in late 2013, the PS4 has been a massive success for the company, selling over 100 million units.\nThe PS4 saw Sony regain its market dominance in the console industry, thanks in part to the lackluster release of the Nintendo Wii U and the marketing nightmare that was the original release of the Xbox One.\nSony continued its strong lineup of exclusive first-party and third-party games for the PS4.\nThe PS4 saw the release of many critically acclaimed games such as the new Spider-Man game, God of War, Uncharted 4, Horizon Zero Dawn, Detroit Become Human, Bloodborne, and many more.\n<h2 class=\"border-bottom\">PlayStation 5</h2>\nSony hopes to continue its dominance in the gaming market with the release of the PlayStation 5 in 2020.\nWhile few details are known about this upcoming console, one thing is for sure is that Sony will ensure it releases with a solid lineup of games.\n<h2 class=\"border-bottom\"><span class=\"console_icons psp_icon align-middle\"></span> PlayStation Portable</h2>\nWhile Sony has proven dominant in the console market, they didn’t successfully manage to translate this to the handheld game market.\nWith Nintendo’s Nintendo DS series selling incredibly well, Sony tried to get in on the market with the release of its handheld game console called the PlayStation Portable or PSP.\nEven though the PSP still managed to sell over 80 million units, this was small in comparison to that of the Nintendo DS, which sold over 288 million units over its four different models.\nThe PlayStation Portables sales suffered partly due to its game library. While there were a few notable games, it didn’t get the same first-party support that Sony showed its home video game consoles.\nThis lack of first-party support hurt Sony when going up against the DS, which had a constant stream of strong first-party games.",

            "description": "Sega or also known as <strong>Se</strong>rvice <strong>Ga</strong>mes is a Japanese video game publisher, developer and hardware company that has their headquarters located in Tokyo, Japan.\nFounded back in 1940 the company use to develop and distribute coin operated games, jukeboxes and slot machines. After a few years of growth they started importing these machines to American military bases within Japan.\nAs they continued to grow they went from being an importer to a manufacturer and started to release some more arcade games. In 1979 as arcade gaming was booming Sega’s revenues shot to over 100 million.\nIn 1982 Sega’s revenues passed the $214 million mark and released their first 3D game for the market. It was not long after this that there was a video gaming crash that sent Sega’s revenue back down to $136 million. Not long after this Sega was purchased for $38 million by a group of investors led by Rosen, Robert Deith and Hayao Nakayama.\nThroughout 1989 to 2001 Sega started their console campaign. These shared both successes and failures to the eventual pull out of the console market in 2001. During this time Nakayama stepped down as chairman and Isao Okawa took over.\nAs of 2002 Sega had have 5 years of net loses had started to struggle with the Okawa giving the company $700 million in a private donation before his death in 2001.\nThe company suffered many setbacks with deals and mergers all falling through as they tried to pick themselves back up. In 2003 Sammy had bought out the outstanding 22% amount of shares that CSK had left. This put the Sammy Chairman Hajime Satomi as the CEO of Sega. After this things started taking a turn with Sammy buying a controlling share of the company in 2004 at a cost of $1.1 billion.\nSega has since been able to turn a profit releasing many successful franchises such as Sonic for all the consoles. The company is now making about $513 million in profit and over 4.9 billion in revenue.",

            "description": "Microsoft has been involved with the gaming industry for quite some time. Before their push to the game console market, Microsoft published several popular game series such as Age of Empires, Links, and Microsoft Flight Simulator.\nThey made a huge leap into the game console market on November 15th, 2001, with the release of the original Xbox.\nSince their original console, Microsoft has become a dominant force in the gaming industry. They have quickly grown to be one of the largest game publishers in the world.\n<h2 class=\"border-bottom\"><span class=\"console_icons xbox_icon align-middle\"></span> Xbox</h2>\nWith the Xbox, Microsoft brought a lot of their expertise with computers to the console market.\nThe Xbox was the first game console to feature a built-in hard disk. This new feature allowed people to save game data directly to the console and not having to rely on separate memory disks.\nA year into its release Microsoft made another big move with the release of Xbox Live. Xbox Live serves as a way of connecting players together.\nThe Xbox saw the release of a few stellar hits. The most notable of these is both the Halo and Fable series.\nEven though the Xbox didn’t sell as well as its main competitor, the PlayStation 2, it proved Microsoft was taking the game console market seriously and still managed to beat Nintendo’s GameCube in unit sales.\nIn terms of emulation, the Xbox has proven to be incredibly difficult. This difficulty may be in part due to the complexity of the CPU and GPU featured in the hardware.\n<h2 class=\"border-bottom\"><span class=\"console_icons xbox_360_icon align-middle\"></span> Xbox 360</h2>\nIn 2005, Microsoft released there second console, the Xbox 360.\nThe Xbox 360 featured Xbox Live as a core component of the console.\nThe console proved quite trying for Microsoft thanks to various hardware issues with the original hardware revision. The “<strong>red ring of death</strong>” became a common occurrence due to the console overheating from a poorly designed heatsink.\nWhile Microsoft offered to fix any console that was afflicted with the issue, it did severely damage their reputation in the console industry.\nDespite the issues that Microsoft faced with the Xbox 360, they still stuck by it and released several iterations to fix the problem.\nDuring the lifespan of the Xbox 360, Microsoft introduced a new piece of technology. This piece of technology was called “Kinect”. Kinect allowed people to interact with games using their bodies.\nThe Kinect ended up selling insanely well and proved to be a huge commercial success for the company. This success may have been partly to blame for the Xbox One’s failures.\nThere have been recent attempts to emulate the Xbox 360 that has proved fruitful, mainly by the <a href=\"https://emulationking.com/xenia/\">Xenia team</a>.\n<h2 class=\"border-bottom\"><span class=\"console_icons xbox_one_icon align-middle\"></span> Xbox One</h2>\nIn 2013 Microsoft released its third video game console, the Xbox One. The original vision of the Xbox One was for it to be an entertainment hub for everything. It would play media, games, tv and everything else.\nTrying to do so much with the console, however, just confused the companies overall message. Many people felt like Microsoft was abandoning the games market to focus on things like TV shows rather than making a great game.\nIn addition to this, the original release of the Xbox One came with the Kinect sensor. The Kinect was not an optional extra and was required to be plugged in regardless of whether you were using it or not. Not only was the Kinect forced, but it also severely hindered the Xbox Ones already lacking system specifications.\nThis series of blunders led to several leads leaving the games division. Microsoft eventually appointed a new president for the gaming division, Phil Spencer.\nPhil Spencer focused the Xbox division back to gaming and made several sweeping changes such as dropping Kinect.\nOne of the most impressive improvements brought to the Xbox One under Phil’s leadership was the backward compatibility. The Xbox One can play numerous Xbox and Xbox 360 games. Some games can even be played at higher resolutions than originally intended.\nThe fact that both the Xbox and Xbox 360 have barely been emulated on the PC shows how big of a feat that would have been to pull off, especially with zero performance degradation.\nSo far, there have been no solid attempts to emulate the Xbox One on the PC.\n<h2 class=\"border-bottom\">Xbox Series X</h2>\nThe next game console from Microsoft is set to be released in 2020 with the name “Xbox Series X”. This console will feature full-backward compatibility with the Xbox One as well as other currently unannounced features.\nWe will update this section when we find out more about the console.",

This prompted the company to split where the arcade division was turned in Atari Games. The consumer electronics division was sold to Jack Termiel’s Tramel Technology which then renamed themselves to Atari Corporation.\nIn 1996 The Atari cooperation was reverse merged with the hard drive disk manufacture J Storage becoming a division within the company.\nLater in 1998 Hasbro bought out the entire of Atari Corporation from JTS and created a new subsidiary known as Atari Interactive.\n\nAfter Infogrames Entertainment (IESA) bought out Hasbro Interactive in 2001 they eventually settled on the name Atari Inc and is still known under that name today.",

Launching with a critical hit like Breath of the Wild gave the Switch the popularity boost that the Wii U never quite achieved.\nNintendo followed up the release of the Switch with several other hits such as Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Splatoon 2, and Super Mario Oddysee. The console has also had fantastic support from 3rd party developers, with a slew of well-optimized ports of high-profile games such as Skyrim.\nThe Nintendo Switch has a couple of unique features. First is the ability for the Switch to be used as both a handheld console and a video game console. This works by using a simple dock that connects to your tv.\nOne thing to note is that when the Switch in handheld mode, its performance is slightly limited to try to preserve battery life.  This means most games will have their resolutions reduced to 720p.\nThe other is the ability of the controllers to also act as motion controllers. However, this ability is not available on the “Lite” version of the Switch.\nThe Nintendo Switch Lite is a handheld only version of the console with non-detachable controllers. It can run any game that has compatibility for the Switches handheld mode.\nSwitch emulation has made an astonishing amount of progress in just a few short years thanks to the effort of the Yuzu Emulator team. The emulator is able to emulate a large amount of the Switch’s library already successfully.\nConsidering the time it took for the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U to be successfully emulated, the progress in developing an emulator for the Nintendo Switch has been surprisingly fast.",

The console was released worldwide in 2012 but sadly lacked the massive amount of hype and excitement that its predecessor had created, this was not helped by a fairly lacking library of launch day games.\nThe Wii U was a primary competitor to Microsoft’s Xbox One, and Sony’s PlayStation 4, sadly though despite those consoles releasing nearly a year after the Wii U’s release, the Wii U just couldn’t make the same level of sales, its hard to say whether this was due to a poor library of games or poor marketing, the name Wii U may of created confusion with some consumers due to its similarities with the Wii name.\nWii U emulation seemed to be something that was never going to happen for a period of time, over the years there was a few attempts here and there that attempted to emulate it but most of those projects were short lived or ran into problems due to the sheer lack of documentation on the inner working on the Wii U.\nIt was not until October 2015 when there was a big breakthrough in emulation, and a massive surprise to the emulation community and that was with the first release of Cemu. Cemu was the first Nintendo Wii U Emulator that started showing real promise. Despite Cemu being closed source there is now another promising emulator that is making progress, namely the open source Decaf emulator project.\nThe biggest hindrance to the Wii U is down to its poor library of games, not only was Nintendo incredibly slow in bringing their own superb IP’s to the console, many 3rd party companies abandoned the console altogether leaving it with a void of games despite some superb surprises like Bayonetta 2.",

            "description": "The Nintendo 3DS was developed by Nintendo as a successor to the original Nintendo DS. While the design is very much familiar the underlying hardware is completely different. It features a more powerful CPU and GPU allowing the device to handle more complex scenes and also the new 3D functionality of the top screen.\nEmulation of the Nintendo 3DS seemed to be something that was never going to end up happening, after several failed attempts and a seemingly lack of real interest from developers there was a sudden surprise release of 3DS Emulator, Citra. Citra came out of nowhere and proved that 3DS Emulation could be done, and as years have gone, shown that it can be done fast and successfully. There was two other attempts but both of those ceased development before showing the amount of progress Citra did, those 3DS emulators being Tron 3DS and 3dmoo. In a way its a good thing as development now appears to be solely focused around Citra, allowing it the best chance to fully emulate the 3DS.\nAs Nintendo has done with the vast majority of its devices. They have introduced a new different feature to the handheld market, and not one people would of expected. This feature is that the top screen acts as a 3D display. This display is designed in a way so the user does not require 3D glasses to see the 3D effect. Though this has some draw backs in its original iteration. That being that if the screen was not looked at directly and at the right angle the 3D effect wouldn’t work properly and make the screen appear blurry. However this is a problem that was solved with Nintendo’s latest 3Ds iteration marketed as “New Nintendo 3DS”.\nThe console has faced two different iterations of its design to date. The first of these being the Nintendo 2DS. This took away the consoles clam shell design and made it a more flat design. It also removed a key feature of the Nintendo 3DS and that is the 3D screen, despite this the actual hardware inside the console remains relatively the same. It is believed that this iteration was aimed at younger children due to a couple of reasons. The first is the lack of a hinge to be damaged, and the second being the lack of the 3D, as it was believed it could put strain on younger eyes.",

This opened up the console to a variety of different games that weren’t present on its competitors systems.\nThe console originally also had two extra functions, one that is not present in the end production model, and one other that has been taken offline.\nThe first of these is the ability to play GameCube games on the Nintendo Wii, this allowed the console to remain fully backwards compatible with all GameCube games as long as you had a GameCube controller.  However this feature was removed for the two later and final versions of the Nintendo Wii, these being the Wii Family Edition and the Wii Mini.\nThe second feature that is no longer present in all versions of the console is its online capabilities and also its WiiConnect24 function that allowed the console to receive updates and messages while its in standby. These were both taken offline by Nintendo, meaning all multiplayer functions of games can no longer be used. Despite these two features being removed the Wii Shop Channel still functions.",

            "description": "The Nintendo DS was Nintendo’s successor to the Game Boy Advance. It introduced two very stand out unique features to the handheld market. While the Nintendo DS did make use of the Game Boy Advance’s SP clamshell design, the way it utilized it much differently.\n\nThe biggest and most obvious of these unique features is the inclusion of two LCD screens that work in tandem, the bottom screen also acts as a touch device allowing interaction with the images on screen. Something, that at the time was quite unusual and different to the standardized single screen and buttons.\nAnother feature the Nintendo DS was the addition of a microphone, this was another different feature games could tap into to use to offer unique game play elements, such as blowing smoke off the screen.\n\nThe other most noticeable feature is its Wi-FI ability that allows it to connect to other Nintendo DS’s, it also had online play through the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection service. However sadly that service was  shut down in 2014 making online useless for all games designed for the Nintendo DS. This forces people to the 3DS if they want to enjoy games with online abilities.\nThe Nintendo DS would end up seeing three separate reiterations of its look and hardware, this is not include the extra large screen versions that were also relate for the DSi version. The first iteration was  the Nintendo DS Lite, this retained all the features of the original fat DS but however was a lot slimmer, and included better screens. There was also slight improvement to the hardware inside the console, however this was mainly battery saving changes then performance increases. The DS Lite also retains the backwards compatibility with Game Boy Advance games  that the original Nintendo DS allowed.\nAfter the Nintendo DS Lite, Nintendo introduced the DSi. This made a few more changes to the formula, adding a camera to the console, improved Wi-Fi and again better screens. Alongside this it also came with iterations that featured a much larger screen. The underling hardware was also improved which meant there were a few games that were made for the DSi specifically. However most developers chose to make sure the game worked on all three iterations, not utilizing the improvements. Despite all these improvements the Nintendo DSi removed the backwards compatibility for Game Boy Advance games that the fat DS and DS Lite had.",

However instead of using the standard full-sized disc’s, Nintendo chose to use miniDVD, excluding the console from being able to play standard DVD’s or audio CD’s due to the smaller size. This made it lack a feature its two competitors of the time, the Xbox and the Playstation 2, and that is simply to also be able to act as a DVD player. While a simple feature, it did add an extra element to a consumers decision on what console to buy, especially during a period where DVD players were costly.\nThe system had the ability to expand its hardware functionality via a port on the bottom of the console. This would only ever end up being used for the consoles Broardband Adapter which gave the console its network functionality, and also the Game Boy Player which allowed Game Boy games to be played on the TV with a GameCube controller.\nWhile the GameCube was praised for having an extensive library of high-quality games, the console failed to gain the sales that its main competitors did. At the end of its lifetime, the Game Cube managed to make 21.74 million sales, falling short by 3 million sales to Microsofts newcomer, the Xbox. However both fell painfully short of the Playstation 2’s 155 million sales.\nDespite the GameCube’s shortfall in sales, it still left a legacy thanks to its high quality games.",

The hand held console managed to hold on to Nintendo’s reign as being the top hand held console seller. This is in part due to the Game Boy Advance selling over 81.51 million units.\nMuch like its predecessor, the Game Boy Advance retained backwards compatibility support, this allowed the console to support both Game Boy Color and Game Boy games. This gave the Game Boy Advance a superb library of high quality and well made games right off the bat. Making it an easy choice for those who have yet to buy a hand held or are thinking of replacing their Game Boy Colour they can still retain their library of games.\nThe Game Boy Advance saw two redesigns, the first of these was the Game Boy Advance SP. This saw the console move to using the clamshell design that is now present in the Nintendo DS. It also introduced a backlight to the consoles design allowing it to be played much better under different lighting conditions and also allow the colours to appear more vibrant.\nThe second of these was the Game Boy Micro. This was essentially a much smaller version of the Game Boy Advance. It however also meant that it lacked a major feature of the Game Boy Advance. This being its backwards compatibility. It however still had some of the feature improvements that the SP introduced such as the backlight.\nThe Game Boy Advance truly set Nintendo as the company to beat in the handheld console market, and has managed to remain king of the market ever since.",

Thanks to largely having the same hardware, this enabled the Game Boy Color to remain backwards compatible with older games.\nThis backwards compatibility was a huge advantage when coming up against its competitors as it allowed the handheld to inherit a large game library right off the bat and not rely completely on a couple of games to generate sales.\nThe Game Boy Color proved to be a huge success, going on to sell over 118.59 million units.

            "description": "The Nintendo 64 (Often abbreviated to N64) is Nintendo’s third attempt at a video game console. It was the world’s true first 64-bit CPU console.\nThe N64 saw the release of many games that are touted as being some of the best of all time. These games range from much raved Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of time to the game touted with revolutionizing the FPS genre GoldenEye 007.\nGraphically the Nintendo 64 was the more powerful of the 5th generation consoles, its boost in power was helped in that it came in at the end of the 5th generation of consoles.\nThe N64’s graphics chip was capable of trilinear filtering, among other more advanced 3D techniques. However, the true power of the N64 console was inhibited by the smaller storage size of the ROM cartridges.\nThe smaller size made developers have to reduce the number of textures used and use other methods such as Gouraud shading or extremely simple textures.\nEmulation wise the N64 is still to be perfected. While the vast majority of games are playable, there are still a few that are completely unplayable. Most problems with N64 emulation and its compatibility doesn’t come from its CPU but from its GPU.\nThe GPU uses methods that are rather complicated to successfully emulate on modern GPU’s, while a modern GPU is far more powerful we simply don’t have the same access to it as developers on the original N64 would have to its GPU.\nIt is also not helped that there is a lack of documentation on the way the GPU operates for specific games. One of the most significant of these being Star Wars Rogue Squadron.\nBest compatibility emulator wise is Project 64. It offers full and fast support for the vast majority of games, video plugin wise, Glide64 is the go-to for best emulation of the GPU side. However, it does sacrifice speed.",

The console was such a commercial failure that it never made it out of Japan and North America.\nOne of the Virtual Boy’s worse points was that its screen was only capable of monochrome colors destroying the immersion of the system. Another problem users found was the lack of games that truly made use of its “3D” features with most of them just using the 3D functionality as a gimmick while still functioning like a 2D game would.",

The console introduced quite a few advanced graphical and sound features when compared against other consoles of its generation. It also was the first start at gaining significant progress in the field of 3D graphics, utilizing its “Super FX”  chip the SNES was able to run games with smoother and more detailed 3D graphics than had been seen before.\nThe SNES was a surprising global success with the console quickly becoming the best-selling 16-bit console despite having a relatively late start  and having to face quite fierce competition from SEGA’s Genesis in North American and European markets.The SNES was successful enough to still remain popular even in the 32-bit era and has continued to be popular among fans, collectors retro gamer’s, and emulation enthusiasts.\nThe SNES is one of the most emulated consoles available, having a plethora of emulators that successfully emulate the console completely such as bSNES which offers 100% accurate emulation of the SNES’s hardware, while it does require a more high end system it does mean that everything shown on the screen is exactly how it would be with the original system, right down to every little bug or quirk.",

The NES is strongly associated with the revitalization of the US video game industry after the crash of the industry in 1983.\nNintendo used the NES to bring to life some of what are they most popular game series to date, these being Super Mario Bros, The Legend of Zelda and Metroid. It also so the birth of Capcom’s Mega Man franchise, Konami’s Castlevania franchise, Square’s(Now Square Enix) Final Fantasy franchise and Enix’s(Now Square Enix) Dragon Quest franchise. All of these franchises are still highly popular and still exist today.\nWhile Nintendo’s NES brought to life some of the greatest game franchises it also gave console manufactures a new outlook in their relationship with third-party software developers by restricting developers from publishing software without licensed approval from the manufacturer. This led to the consoles having much more high quality software titles, and in turn better public outlook on the console.\nWhile the console is no longer being manufactured, the console has been emulated to the point where almost all hardware functionality has been replicated on the computer, with some emulators such as Nestopia providing cycle accurate emulation of the original hardware, meaning what is shown on screen should be exactly what the original console would of produced.",

Both of these technologies were only released in 2020, meaning that they were cutting edge at the time of the release.\nWhere Sony has made their most significant changes is their new PS5 DualSense controller. On the outside, it features a more refined shape with better button placements.\nOn the inside of the controller is where the real magic occurs. Thanks to the introduction of new haptic technology, the rumble has way more fidelity.\nAdditionally, the triggers have been reworked so that they can have a feel of tension as you press them. Games can configure these triggers so that they have different reactions depending on the task. For example, when pulling back a bow, you can feel the tension increase as you pull the trigger.\nOut of all the changes introduced by the new hardware, the controller is what helps set the console apart from previous generations.\nAt this stage there is <strong>no currently successful emulation projects for the PlayStation 5</strong>. Be wary of any projects claiming that they can emulate any part of the PS5 as it is a relatively new piece of hardware.\nWe will update this page and provide links to emulators as projects manage to get off the ground.",

            "description": "The PlayStation Vita was Sony’s second attempt at building a handheld video game console. It was released in 2011 during the eighth generation of video game consoles, going up against the Nintendo 3DS. \nThe PS Vita boasted modest specs for the time. The first iteration even boasted an OLED screen. It also featured complete backwards compatibility for all PlayStation Portable games.\nYou could even use the PS Vita as a remote play device for your PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3. Remote play allowed you to play games without needing to use a TV.\nWhile the PS Vita has built up quite a loyal fanbase that has modified the device for their own uses, overall, the console was a commercial failure. It failed to get near the same amount of sales as its competitor with the estimated final sales sitting at about 16 million units worldwide.\nAnalysts primarily point to this failure being of Sony’s own making. During the PS Vita’s lifetime, there were barely any games produced by Sony for the device. Additionally, due to Sony’s lack of support, there was never any real big push from 3rd party studios to support the device.\nThe PS Vita is a popular device for running emulated games, thanks to the broader community’s great work. People choose it as a suitable handheld emulation device thanks to its decent power, built-in support for PSP and PlayStation 1 games, and overall design.\nHowever, emulation of the PlayStation Vita has had slow progress, primarily due to programmers’ lack of interest. There is currently only one actively developed emulator that has managed to produce results.\nThat PS Vita emulator being Vita3k. This emulator is still highly experimental and can only play a few commercial games.",

It competed against Microsoft’s Xbox 360 and Nintendo’s Wii in what was a bitterly fought battle between the 3 companies, and a battle that was thought right up to the end of the seventh generation of video game consoles.\nThe PS3 started slowly with both the Nintendo Wii and the Xbox 360 launching a year before the PS3, while this hurt it in the short time it gave more will to Sony to push there console hard. Leading to the console having some of the greatest video games of all time, such as the excellent Metal Gear Solid IV, the Uncharted series, and The Last of Us, this is among a plethora of other highly successful and highly regarded games.\nHowever the delayed launch was not the only negative point to the PS3, while it included much more powerful GPU and CPU then its two competitors, there was a significant flaw with the hardware. That being it was incredibly hard to program for with Sony choosing to make use of the powerful but complex Cell processors. This made it difficult for companies to develop for the console especially near the start of the generation as most companies didn’t have the chance to work out the best way to utilize the processor.\nThis cell processor is also what makes emulating the PS3 extremely difficult, many people thought it would make emulation of the PS3 unachievable. However these doubts were put to rest when PS3 Emulator RPCS3 was released by DH & Hykem, it proved that emulation of the complicated Cell architecture could be achieved. This was an extremely remarkable and impressive achievement. Over 5 years on from its initial release, RPCS3 is now even managing to emulate actual commercial games and get in game, and even be playable at some decent speeds.",

The first to try and tackle it was the PSP Emulator, PSPE. While PSPE could never actually emulate a commercial PSP game, it did prove that PSP emulation could be done.

The most modern PSP Emulator is PPSSPP, which has proven itself to be able to emulate basically all PSP games faithfully while offering numerous extra features so the games can be rendered in HD. PSP Emulation is regarded as now being fairly complete, large in thanks to the efforts of the PPSSPP team.\nThe PSP sported high end hardware for its time, boasting a more powerful processor and GPU then its competitor the Nintendo DS. It also featured an assortment of different features such as a tv tuner, media player and various other multimedia capabilities. The device was also meant to sport the capability to be able to connect directly the the PlayStation 3 as well.\nThe PSP had a weird way of storing its games, unlike Nintendo’s hand-held consoles and the various others who tried to beat Nintendo over the years, Sony chose to make use of a optical disc format, bucking the trend of using cartridges for games.

It competed against Sega’s final console entry, the SEGA Dreamcast, Nintendo’s GameCube and Microsoft Xbox.\nA key feature to the PlayStation 2 was its ability to be fully backward compatible with the PlayStation 1 (PSX) games. This means a user who chose to buy the new console did not have to ditch there whole games library or retain the older console. This was in stark contrast to Sony’s competitors at the time, as a new console often meant all your games were rendered useless. The PS2 also managed to retain support for the previous generations’ Dualshock controllers.\nEmulation of the PS2 has been somewhat successful, largely in thanks to the PCSX2 emulation project. PCSX2 was originally started by the development team, who made the PlayStation 1 (PSX) Emulator, PCSX.\nPCSX2 proved that the emulation of the PS2 could be achieved.

Releasing in 1994 in Japan and then 1995 in North America and the rest of the world, the PlayStation went on to become the biggest selling console of the fifth generation of video game consoles, and the first ever video game console to sell over 100 million units. It was the PlayStations and Sony’s jump start into becoming one of the most formidable opponents in the gaming world.\nThe PlayStation’s biggest competitors during the fifth generation of video game consoles was the Nintendo 64 and the Sega Saturn. Despite going up against incredibly stiff competition with video game giants Nintendo and Sega dominating the market, the PlayStation managed to overcome both of them, overtaking that of the Nintendo 64 and leaving the Sega Saturn in distant third place. One of the biggest advantages of the PlayStation was that it relied on discs, though cartridges were an awful lot faster and didn’t suffer as many durability issues, they just didn’t have the same storage space that a CD could provide. CD’s were an awful lot cheaper to produce, something that appealed heavily to publishers as there wasn’t as significant of a risk to produce large quantities of a game.\nPlayStation (PSX) emulation is fairly complete, with the vast majority of games able to run flawlessly with no major issues, the focus of most PSX emulators have now turned to focus on increasing the accuracy and speed of their emulation over trying to increase compatibility. This is alongside increasing features such as being able to successfully render PSX games at higher internal resolutions. There is several great PlayStation emulators, though most are plugin based, ePXSE, PCSX-R are both highly capable emulators.",

It was released on November 22, 1994 in Japan, May 11 1995 in North American and July 8, 1995 in Europe. It is the successor the successful Sega Genesis.\nThe North American launch was a surprise launch that caught many of the retailers by surprise as only a few retailers had been told about this. As a result few retailers refused to stock any of Sega’s products. The console boasted a dual-CPU setup with a total of eight processors. The games also were in a CD-ROM format.\nThe Saturn’s game library consisted mostly of the Arcade ports that included games such as Daytona USA, Last Bronx, Die Hard Arcade and many more. In 1998 surprisingly the system had more games than its competitor the Nintendo 64. The Saturn faced many problems in the American marketplace after selling well in Japan. The console was released 4 months prior and faced very shaky sales and to top it off the release of the Nintendo 64 in 1996 basically was the final nail in the coffin, with the SEGA Saturn being discontinued in 1998. The Sega Saturn sold a total of only 9.5 million units worldwide and was considered a commercial failure.\nAs there was a decline in the industry the failure of the Sega Saturn put a lot of financial strain onto the company. This caused departures within the company and for the discontinuation of the system leaving the Western Market without any Sega games for over a year.",

The CPU also ran at a much faster pace but this wasn’t enough to stop the NES and its strong franchise lines from outdoing them in sales.There was a few accessories developed for the system such as 3D glasses and a light gun both being designed to work with a range of specially developed games.\nThe console faced strong competition from Nintendo with the Sega Master System only selling about 10-13 million units over its life time which is far less than the NES that sold over 62 million.\n\nThe game library was criticised of being too small and needed to be more substantial.

            "description": "The Xbox Series S/X made up a part of Microsoft’s ninth generation of video game consoles and was released at the end of 2020. These consoles are the successor to the Xbox One and represent the companies fourth attempt at building its own video game console.\nLike the PlayStation 5, the Xbox Series console sported some of the latest processing technologies from AMD. These processing technologies are AMD’s Zen 2 CPU architecture and their RDNA 2 GPU architecture.\nThe use of these architectures allows the Xbox’s processor to match that of what was a relatively high-end computer at the time of release.\nValue-wise this put the Xbox Series console in an excellent position. They boasted pretty high-end CPU and GPU performance at a fraction of what it would cost to build a PC of the same capabilities.\nWhen marketing their latest Xbox consoles Microsoft focused a lot on their backward compatibility capabilities.\nThe Xbox Series consoles are fully backward compatible with the Xbox One. They even support a large number of games from the Xbox 360 and the original Xbox.\nOn the hardware side, the Xbox Series consoles set out to achieve a few things. The first was to improve the storage speed of the device significantly. Game consoles for years have relied on slow hard drives. The Xbox Series made the jump to an NVMe drive. These drives are incredibly fast, allowing the console to load data almost instantly.\nThese gave rise to features such as Xbox’s Quick Resume. This feature stored the game’s current game state on the NVMe drive to quickly load back into memory.\nAs the Xbox Series consoles are relatively new, there have been no successful attempts at emulating the video game console. Be careful if you see any website claiming they have a fully working Xbox Series emulator.\nWe will update this page once there is progress on developing an emulator of the Xbox Series.",

This is can be attributed to a very poor marketing effort that left consumers confused.\nThe announcement conference of the Xbox One featured a large segment dedicated to non gaming features, and then the time that was left focused on policies that were never explained properly. Such as the apparent “always-online” feature, and the original policy of being unable to trade in games, replacing the normal console system with a system much like the extremely popular PC Gaming platform, Steam.\nThe next few weeks after the Xbox One’s announcement there was a few attempts to try and clarify there policies but those attempts just ended up throwing fuel on the fire and confusing the consumers even further. Eventually the two key policies of the console ended up being rolled back for the more traditional style. But it ended up with two high level Microsoft employees having to stand down, the most notable of these being the head of Xbox, Don Mattrick. Ultimately the Xbox One never recovered from the disaster that it was the announcement, Sony utilized the mess up to promote there console and appear to be the good guys helping them gain a majority early on in the consoles life.\nEmulation of the Xbox One is nothing but a pipe dream at this moment, there is no current effort to try and emulate the console, and there does not currently appear to be any real interest in a Xbox One emulator. Please note if you do find any supposed Xbox One emulators on the internet, steer clear of them as they are more then likely loaded with adware.\nIt is currently to difficult to find out how well the Xbox One is doing as Microsoft chose to cease disclosing the Xbox One Sold unit numbers.\n<div class=\"et_pb_row et_pb_row_2 et_pb_row_fullwidth\">\n<div class=\"et_pb_column et_pb_column_4_4 et_pb_column_2 et_pb_css_mix_blend_mode_passthrough et-last-child\">\n<div class=\"et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_3 et_pb_bg_layout_light et_pb_text_align_left\">\n<div class=\"et_pb_text_inner\">\n<h2>Xbox One Emulators</h2>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_4 et_pb_bg_layout_light et_pb_text_align_left\">\n<div class=\"et_pb_text_inner\">\nThere is currently <strong>no</strong> Xbox One emulator in development, or any Xbox One emulator released at all.\n\nPlease note that if you find any on the internet at this time, it is likely a <strong>fake, </strong>even more so if it claims to actually be able to one any games fully.\nPlease steer clear of any Xbox One Emulators.

The Xbox 360 managed to sell over 84 million units, an impressive feat despite suffering some serious setbacks. Initial versions of the Xbox 360 suffered from a severe hardware failure, often refereed to as the “Red Ring of Death”. This was caused by a poor heat sink and bracket that would over time cause the processor to bend and be lifted from the main board.\nEmulation of the Xbox 360 seemed like a very far fetched idea up considering the sheer difficulty developers had trying to emulate the original Xbox. There is one incredibly promising Xbox 360 emulator that has surfaced, and that is the surprising Xenia. it has already managed to get in game in a variety of different games and is already showing great promise that it will manage to successfully emulate the system.\nThe Xbox 360 was an impressive showing from Microsoft, boasting a much improved online service, something that ended up becoming a core pillar of the device thanks to its sheer success in the previous generation of consoles. The Xbox 360 also boasted a rather robust set of media center abilities, however unlike the PlayStation 3, Microsoft made the decision to only include a DVD drive. While Microsoft eventually brought out an addon that implemented the HD DVD, it ended up a failed effort as the HD DVD ultimately failed after Blu-ray gained significant support.\nUltimately the Xbox 360 was a very successful video game console, while not the top selling seventh generation video game console, it did bring with it some of the most memorable games of the generation. One of the most notable game series of those is the Gears of War series, which has now become a pillar of Xbox gaming alongside the fantastic open world racing game, Forza Horizon and the stellar Forza Motorsport series.",

It came in the sixth generation of video game consoles, going up against the Nintendo GameCube, the SEGA Dreamcast and the Sony PS2.\nThe Xbox was different to all of the consoles of its time, Instead of utilizing highly customized pieces of hardware like the Dreamcast and PlayStation 2 did, the Xbox instead used hardware that was much more familiar to them. That being they utilized a PC style system and architecture for there console, bringing in the in-built hard drive to store save games directly to the console, removing the need to purchase memory cards.\nEmulation of the Xbox so far has not managed to get very far, despite a couple of attempts emulation has basically never gotten past managing to get in-game in a couple of games. Performance is not to great in the emulators either. The difficulty of Xbox Emulation is likely due to how much in common it has with the PC Architecture and the sheer lack of any real documentation on how everything works. There is currently only one real Xbox emulator project that is making ground, and that is the XQEMU project.\nIt also brought with it an Ethernet port, and was the first video game console to bring together a proper online gaming community with there console thanks to the introduction of Xbox Live. Xbox Live didn’t just let you play games with other people, it also let you add friends to a buddy list and interact with them. Xbox’s network prowess was helped by there better and more reliable services coupled alongside the fantastic online gameplay of Halo 2.\nUltimately the Xbox fared extremely well for there first video game console, coming distant second to the PlayStation 2. Ending with over 24 million units sold, it proved more popular then Nintendo’s GameCube and eclipsed that of the SEGA Dreamcast.",

The console had only sold about 250 thousand.\nThe Jaguar faced many problems that contributed to its failure such as extensive delays in development of the software for the console and also the introduction of products into the market by both Sega and Sony in 1995.\nThe Atari Jaguar had quite a few different accessories that could add functionality to the console. Just to name a few there was the cd add-on, memory track, team tap and many more.\nThere was a total of 82 games released for the console 67 were for the console itself and the other 15 were for the CD add-on.

Lifetime sales of the Lynx totalled out to be about 7 million units when combined with the game gear. The Gameboy had sold 16 million units by the same time.\nThe handheld console received good praise by the critics at the time with one critic claiming that it “throws the Gameboy into the prehistoric age” citing the built-in object scaling capabilities and the strong multiplayer system gave it a huge advantage over the Gameboy.",

Also due to the strong feedback Atari received regarding not being able to play previous games on the 5200 they made sure this console was able to play almost all the games from the 2600.\nAlso as growing concerns from the community that a home PC was a better investment than a console the system was designed to be fully fledged home computer. You were able to plug in a keyboard and other peripherals such as disk drives and printers.\nThe console even though didn’t do nearly as well as the NES, but was still profitable for Atari, with it managing to sell over 3.8 million units worldwide. On January 1<sup>st</sup> 1992 Atari announced that the production of the Atari 7800 will end only being able to capture 12% while its rival Nintendo controlled 80%",

This Switch emulator is primarily written by the same team that created the popular 3DS Emulator, Citra.\nWhile still a relatively new emulator, Yuzu has managed to already successfully emulate numerous elements of the Nintendo Switch at speed comparable to the original hardware.\nThe team has even emulated the BCAT Switch service that is used to add content to games dynamically. Using the emulated service, the Yuzu team can replicate and create their own in-game events.\nAn example of the things this enables is giving you extra items when starting the game in Breath of the Wild or more ability chunks in Splatoon 2.\nIn addition to this, the emulator can even render Switch games at higher resolutions than the original hardware intended, meaning you can play games at resolutions higher than 1080p.\nWhile Yuzu can not currently run most commercial games, the team is making a tremendous amount of progress every day. The Yuzu team provides a list of all Switch games and how well they work with the emulator. You can view this list by checking out the compatibility list.\nRecent versions of Yuzu have added support for Vulkan. Vulkan allows faster rendering thanks to less CPU overhead and also giving a speed boost to those using AMD GPUs.\nYuzu has builds available for Windows and Linux. Builds for macOS are no longer available due to Apple removing OpenGL support from macOS in favor of their own graphics API.\nIf you want to check out the development process of this Switch emulator, you can check out the official Yuzu GitHub repository. The repository also contains steps on how you can compile this Switch emulator on your system.\nBelow you will find download links for Yuzu for both the Windows and Linux operating systems.",

            "description": "Cemu is a Nintendo Wii U emulator for Windows. it was the biggest breakthrough in emulation for the Wii U. While there had been a couple of attempts prior to the release of Cemu to emulate the Wii U, none had managed to boot up a Wii U game or get near being able to get in game.\nCemu had popped seemingly out of nowhere, with version 1.0.0.0 being released in October 2015. Before this emulation of the Wii U was seemingly out of reach but Cemu proved that it could be done when it could successfully boot titles to the loading screens.\nShortly after the first release, games started being able to get in game with varying degrees of speed and graphical issues. As of the latest version, many games are in fact now playable. Games such as Super Mario World and Mario Kart 8 can now be played through from start to finish with little to no issue and startlingly accurate graphics, though there will be issues here and there.\nCemu has come an extremely long way in an incredibly short time, in little over a year it has gone from just being able to boot games to being able to successfully emulate a few games completely at high speeds. It is definitely an emulator to keep an eye on as so far it has been extremely promising.",

It is the open source alternative to the excellent proprietary Wii U emulator, CEMU.\nWhile Decaf doesn’t emulate the Wii U as good as CEMU at the moment, it is an extremely promising start and is already making big strides to catch up to CEMU in emulation capabilities.\nInitially, Decaf emulator was a Windows 10 only Wii U emulator, and this was due to its initial use of DirectX 12. However, the primary developer of Decaf, Exjam, made the decision to drop DirectX 12 in favor of OpenGL 4.5. This change allows Decaf emulator to be multi-platform.\nDecaf is already able to run some commercial Wii U games, so it’s great if you’re looking to play Wii u games. However, at this moment, you are likely to run into an assortment of graphical issues and severe bugs. Decaf is very much in the experimental stage, but Decaf has made quick progress in just a few short months.",

Citra has quickly become THE Nintendo 3DS Emulator, thanks to a large development community that has worked tirelessly to reverse engineer the functions of the 3DS and the coming together of the various other 3DS emulator attempts has allowed Citra to become the most promising attempt yet to fully emulate the Nintendo 3DS.\nWhile Citra is coming along to be the best Nintendo 3DS Emulator, and is in fact the only one being actively developed now, don’t expect it to be able to run most games you throw at it, and don’t expect to achieve great speeds with the games that do run, at this time, Citra is still highly experimental. While it has in recent months shown a great amount of improvement if your not prepared to battle through bugs to play a game, please wait a few more months and allow the developers to further develop Citra.",

HLE support of the base 3DS operating system to help support userland applications.

            "description": "Dolphin Emulator is a GameCube emulator and Nintendo Wii emulator that started off its routes as just being a pure GameCube emulator. However once the release of the Nintendo Wii came round, the team realized that the hardware was so similar that increasing Dolphin’s support to also cover the Nintendo Wii was not a huge technical challenge. They found that it did not require significant rewrites of Dolphin Emulator to be able to also be a Wii Emulator.\nDolphin Emulator made its mark by being the first GameCube emulator that was actually able to successfully emulate a commercially released game. However despite achieving this, Dolphin was nearly gone completely when it was discontinued in 2004. Luckily a year later in 2005, the developers revived the Dolphin Emulator project adding minor improvements and beginning the first basic audio support.\nThen in 2008 is when Dolphin Emulator really started making its breakthroughs after being moved into the public domain and being open sourced. Leading to its development as the best emulator for both the GameCube and the Wii. Dolphin emulator now successfully emulates almost every single game available on both systems. Its development has seemed to of never slowed down as the now large amount of developers have managed to successfully emulate even some of the most complicated functions of the GameCube and Wii.\nThanks to its large pool of developers, Dolphin Emulator is the best GameCube emulator about, and the best and only Nintendo Wii emulator. However expect with some games, to emulate them perfectly you will require a computer with decent hardware, as some functions are quite resource intensive to emulate.",

DeSmuMe was the first NDS emulator that was capable of successfully running several NDS roms.\nThanks to DeSmuME’s OpenGL render and dynamic recompiler it is one of the best performing emulators for the DS that you can find.\nDeSmuME came about after several developers who had forked YopYop156’s code decided to unite together which ended up with the release of DeSmuME 0.5.0. The merging of resources has allowed DeSmuME to become one of the best NDS emulators around, its only real competitor being NO$GBA.\nDevelopment has slowed down significantly, as work has been done to port DeSmuME to other systems such as Mac OS X, with a lot of development time being spent on the Coaca port. However there still is a significant amount of changes to the core system that has been fixing issues in a variety of games.\nDeSmuME was originally capable of connecting to the Nintendo DS’s WiFI service, but that functionality was eventually terminated after Nintendo detected the connections, users have lobbied for the WiFi functionality to be introduced back into DeSmuME but Nintendo eventually shut down the online play of NDS Games completely rendering the effort pointless.",

            "description": "iDeaS Emulator is a once popular Nintendo DS Emulator. It was capable of running a lot of commercial NDS games. To achieve decent graphical speed iDeaS Emulator makes use of an OpenGL renderer. iDeaS had successfully managed to emulate the ARM7 CPU completely, which also gives it the ability to emulate GBA games.\nThe iDeaS team had also managed to make significant inroads on emulating the ARM9 Dual Screen processor with estimated completion of the emulation of the processor being at about 99%. This allows it to successfully run many commercial games such as Super Mario 64 DS and Pokemon Black and White. However while these games should all run fine, the GPU emulation was never fully completed as development ended.\niDeaS comes with a plugin system as well, this is something that is not found in any other Nintendo DS emulator, allowing developers to add extra support into the emulator without needing access to the core code. We have provided the available plugins below, however we cant say that they all still function correctly.",

If development was continued DuoS would of surely become one of the best NDS Emulators around.",

This is more here for those who are interested in trying out some of the older generation of emulators and seeing how emulation of the GameCube improved over time.",

These forks introduced certain features, such as the ability to link two Game Boys together through the emulator.\nThese forks were ultimately combined together in a single package that went by the name Visual Boy Advance – Merge (VBA-M). This fork adds several features while also ensuring the codebase was probably maintained and bugs were quenched as they popped up.\nThis has helped ensure the VBA emulator is one of the best choices for the Game Boy systems.",

The code is available to view over on GitHub.\nThe aim is to emulate the SNES original hardware as accurately as possible through the use of low-level emulation. It has the added ability of also using cycle-accurate emulation.\nHigan touts the ability to run every commercially SNES title that has been released without any bugs that were not originally in the game itself.\nThe higan emulator has grown to now experimentally emulate the NES, Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and the Game Boy Advance. This wide range of consoles makes it one of the more versatile emulators around. However, the emulation outside of the SNES still needs more work to get to the same accuracy and capabilities.\nThe emulator also offers support for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux (Available from Debian packages).",

            "description": "GBE + is a GBA Emulator and GBC emulator written by Shonumi. It is the continuation of his original GBA Emulator, GB Enhanced. The goal of the project is to create an emulator written in C++ utilizing the SDL library that proves to be highly portable while sporting functionality that is not traditionally found in GBA and GBC emulators. The plan is to attempt to document the GBC’s and GBA’s functions through clean easy to understand code while still allowing an assortment of enhancements.\nWhile the GBA Emulation is still rather experimental it should be able to run most games with a varying amount of playability or visible glitches. The GBC side of the emulation however is much more complete and is considered more ready for prime time use.\n\nA feature that is a big star of the GBE+ project and is something new to the GBA and GBC emulation scene is the ability to use custom graphics.\nThis custom graphics is the ability for GBE + to dump or extract sprites and backgrounds directly out of the game, let the user then edit them, and then have the ability to re-inject those sprites and backgrounds directly back into the game dynamically. This feature is a big plus for the emulator as it allows users to modify the look and feel of a game without needing to utilize rom hacking. Anything that you can see in a game can be edited, with a few exceptions. However this does mean you can bring colour into what used to be a monochrome game.\nGBE+ is still very much a work in progress emulator, but is proving to be incredibly promising, introducing features into the GBA and GBC emulation scene that have been sadly lacking. With any like Shonumi will continue work on this emulator as so far the project is showing an incredible amount of promise.",

However in recent years some developers have tried modding the released source code to help improve game play, like modifications to the frequency at which emulated N64 core is processed to increase FPS in certain games like Goldeneye 64 to its originally intended max rate of 60fps, and also allowing it decreased for games that normally run at a lower rate already like Mario Kart 64.",

            "description": "Snes9x is an open source emulator for the Super Nintendo written in C++. The emulator is  designed to be highly portable, compatible and offer good emulation speed. This allows it to be easily compiled across multiple systems easily.\n\nThe team behind Snes9x provides official builds for several systems.\nThese systems being Windows, Linux, Mac OS X and Android. ZSNES was one of the first emulators to offer support for the advanced features of the SNES. Recent versions of the emulator have heavily improved its accuracy while trying not to sacrifice its speed.\nThe emulator is a perfect replacement of bsnes (higan) if your computer is unable to handle the accuracy that higan uses at the sacrifice of speed. Despite the original Snes9x team abandoning the project, a new team has come together to continue work on it.\nHowever work has not progressed hugely. Despite this it remains one of the best emulators for the SNES, with a very high compatibility rate and extra enhancement features. Of course it doesn’t emulate games as accurately as an emulator like higan would, however it doesn’t have the associated higher-end hardware requirements.",

It also includes some extra non-essential features such as 44.1khz audio, movie creation, and a plethora of different video filters.\nSadly ZSNES is no longer in active development with its last stable release being back in 2007, however despite this its still one of the best SNES emulators around especially when confronted with a more performance restricted system.

Despite starting off as a NES Emulator, the developer decided to focus on another emulator after managing to emulate the NES extremely successfully with little to not problems.\nNemulator’s NES Emulation is now fully developed with support for the vast majority of the NES’s abundant function mappers, Nemulator even goes as far as to add support for even unofficial and undocumented opcodes allowing it to run the vast majority of NES games without any issues. The NES Emulator also features support for cycle-accurate timing.\nIn Version 4.0, the developer decided to introduce additional support to the emulator, adding in support for the SEGA Master System. While this emulation is relatively new to Nemulator, it so far appears to be functioning quite well and is definitely an emulator worth checking out for both the SEGA Master System and the NES.",

Originally developed by programmers DH and Hykem back in 2011, they managed to show that making a PS3 emulator could be done by emulating simple homebrew.\n3 years later, and the PS3 emulator started showing success in being able to emulate actual commercial PS3 games with numerous games now able be playable in some form. However emulation is currently quite slow, as is to be expected with such a complicated project. As long as development continues of this project though, and more developers come on board theres a massive chance full emulation of the PS3 could be achieved now that the ground work has been laid.\n<strong>Note: </strong>We currently do not have access to Mac OS X builds of this emulator.",

It boasts an impressive multi platform lineup, being able to be run an assortment of systems such as Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, iOS, Android and even more obscure systems like Blackberry.\nThe original author, Henrik Rydgård, planned the emulator to be not only extremely fast, but also very highly portable, and he managed to pull that off incredibly successfully. For those who don’t know Henrik Rydgård was one of the co-founders of the superb Dolphin Emulator.\nIn just 3 years PPSSPP managed to become the best PSP emulator around, boasting a high compatibility rate while still being able to render the games faithfully and fast.\nThe developers even managed to end up adding support for Sony’s Proprietary audio codec, ATRAC3plus. Along with this there is a variety of different enhancements you can use to make the PSP games look much nicer at higher resolutions, including being able to increase the internal rendering resolution that the PSP would of rendered at, rather then just stretching the image to the screen size.\n<strong>Note</strong>: Linux and Mac OS X builds rely on SDL, instructions are below on how to install the correct version of SDL for PPSPP to run on those systems.\n<h2 class=\"h5\">Linux PPSSPP Instructions</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Open a Terminal instance</li>\n<li><b>For Debian/Ubuntu and their derivatives:</b> Install the “libsdl2-dev” package.</li>\n<li><b>For Fedora/RHEL and their derivatives:</b> Install the “SDL2-devel” package.</li>\n<li><b>For BSD-based distros:</b> Install the “sdl2” package.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"h5\">Mac OS X Instructions</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Open the Terminal app.</li>\n<li>Paste this into a Terminal:\n <code class=\"small\">ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"</code></li>\n<li>Follow the instructions, and wait for installation to finish.</li>\n<li>Paste this into a Terminal: <code>brew install sdl2</code></li>\n</ul>",

            "description": "JPCSP is one of the most advanced PSP Emulators available. JCPSP has shown an incredible amount of progress and impressive speed despite being built in a slower language then most other emulators. There is one big advantage to using Java for an emulator, and that is that the code tends to be multiplatform friendly from the get go, meaning you don’t have to waste a lot of development time tweaking code to work on specific platforms.\nDespite JPCSP being written mainly in java, it manages to achieve 100% emulation speed in some commercial games, this is quite an impressive feat for any PSP Emulators. It achieves this by taking the full advantage of dual-core CPU’s, allowing it to match the same dual-core architecture that is featured in the PSP itself. The more cores you have should also improve emulation even more, as it allows the free cores to work just on Java’s JIT compiler and the graphics cache.\nDespite this project still just being a beta, it already offers compatibility for over 600 games. While not as vast as PPSSPP’s 919 odd games that are marked as playable, it is still impressive none the less.\nThanks to continued active development, JPCSP has taken the place as probably the second best PSP emulator, and challenges PPSSPP extremely well.",

            "description": "PCSX2 is a extremely successful PS2 Emulator that is available on Windows, Linux and even Mac OS X. Made by part of the team that brought about PCSX-Reloaded for the PlayStation one. It manages to emulate the PS2 extremely well, being both fast, accurate and highly compatible. Boasting that over 94.94% of the PS2’s massive 2568 games are playable.\nThis is an amazing progress for any emulator, let alone one that tries to tackle one of the more complicated systems in the 6th generation of video game consoles. PCSX2’s success is in part thanks to it being the only real actively developed PS2 Emulator. Focused development, and over 14 years of active development time has allowed the emulator to mature extremely well. The team over the years has tackled a variety of different complicated issues with emulating the PS2. The early versions of PCSX2 focused on just getting into the PS2 loading screen and being able to actually emulate the complicated PlayStation 2 bios,\nRecent versions have begun focusing on trying to bring highly accurate emulation without sacrificing the speed of the emulator, this is alongside trying to fix a lot of the edge cases that have cropped up while trying to emulate some games. While emulation might work perfectly for one, some games use certain tricks that require special coding to be able to emulate.\nIts worth noting that PCSX2 makes use of the same plugin specification that was set out by the now long abandoned PSEmu Pro emulator for the PlayStation 1. This allows some features of the PS2 such as the graphics and audio to be handled externally, this does mean that compatibility can differ depending on what plugins you use.\n<strong>Note</strong>: PCSX2 requires the PS2 Bios files to be able to run.",

            "description": "Play! is a relatively new PS2 emulator that has the goal of being portable across Windows, OSX, iOS, and Android platforms. It is primarily developed by a single developer, that developer being Jean-Philip Desjardins.\nPlay! is written in C/C++ and is designed to make use of instruction caching and a dynamic recompiler scheme to try and achieve better performance while emulating the PS2’s complicated CPU.\nThe project is designed as a way for Jean-Philip Desjardins to sharpen his own programming skills and for him to gain more experience in the computer engineering and software engineering fields. Which so far, is an excellent showcase as the emulator is slowly but surely showing some good progress. It currently can run a few games, which is a great achievement in itself, but it runs them with a lot of issues.\nIf the development is kept up, Play! should become a fantastic emulator with a few years of active development put into it.",

It was a good proof of concept, but sadly as said before, development never really gained much momentum and it never saw another release.\nThere was signs of Roor coming back to finish off his development on the emulator, but he seems to of disappeared again as well.\n<strong>Note</strong>: PS2emu requires the PS2 Bios files to be able to run.\nAlso note that this emulator requires plugins and does not come with any in the download.",

This means there is no specific needs for a very particular version of Windows, no specially modified Video driver, no obscure and hard to find plugins, no requirement for virtual cd-roms, no requirement to have the PSX Bios to operate or require specific game setting tweaks to get games to run without any issues.\nEmulation of the PSX Hardware is basically fully complete, with all features completed and working in some form, however there is always some edge cases that can be ran into so there may be some games that suffer from various issues still. A lot of work however has been done to try and ensure the core is as stable as possible.\nNo$PSX like some of the other top PSX emulators, emulates the BIOS via what is called a BIOS-clone. \nThis has a few advantages, first of those is that it is free and legal, the PSX Bios itself is covered under copyright so your technically not allowed to download it. Secondly the cloned bios has the ability to be much faster then the original PSX bios, meaning No$PSX can run some games faster just thanks to an optimized clone.\nHowever there is one down side, there is a chance that compatibility may not be as good, this is mainly due to games that need to apply unknown patches to the clone bios. No$PSX tries to replicate them patches where possible but it can’t cover all of them.",

With releases put out very rapidly in a short amount of time it became regarded as a very promising emulator.\nThe last few versions before development ended on PSXeven focused on trying to improve the accuracy and stability of the emulator while also trying to ensure that the interpreter core will be fast enough on most computers.\nPSXeven become renowned for its fantastic simple user interface that is very easy for people to understand. It also features a few inbuilt functions you usually find separate from other PSX emulators.\nThese features are an in-built memory card manager and a very useful and great game image compression tool. Like most PSX Emulators PSXeven makes use of a plugin based system, this allows it to make use of the same plugins that both ePSXe and PCSX-Reloaded can run making it a more versatile plugin and still makes it a viable plugin even in the modern days.\nPSXeven showed a fair amount of promise that it would be able to emulate the PlayStation 1 well but development never lived long enough for the emulator to full mature unlike its competitors ePSXe and PCSX-Reloaded. \nPSXeven joins a long line of short lived PlayStation emulators that could of been great if they had just been continued or the source code released.\nPlease note that this emulator requires the PSX Bios to be able to run.",

It achieved this by being written primarily in assembly, this allowed the developers to create very precise optimizations in there code, however it also made it an awful lot more complicated.\nThe Bleem! PSX Emulator also managed to make use of the PC’s graphics hardware to increase the speed of 3D rendering. For its time Bleem! had showed massive promise, helped in part by its commercial nature. Ultimately Bleem! went bankrupt, they may of won the court cases with Sony, but they couldn’t afford the legal fees and had to shut down.\nHowever thanks to them fighting the court case and winning it helped pave the wave for a huge increase in freeware PSX Emulators as it proved in law that an emulator can’t be sued for copyright.\nPlease note Bleem! may not run on any operating system newer then Windows 98. Our team hasn’t personally tested this yet, so drop us a line below if it manages to run.",

            "description": "Chankast was one of the first SEGA Dreamcast emulators to actually successfully emulate a commercial Dreamcast game. it was built for x86 platforms, and for its time utilized advanced techniques to achieve not only high compatibility emulation but also have the ability to get a decent speed in Dreamcast games, something that was a massive thing to achieve back in 2004.\nIt even managed to run games at a decent speed thanks to the early adoption of processor optimizations such as the SSE Instruction set. Considering what Chankast managed to achieve during its short lifespan its nothing short of a miracle as it for a short while beat out a few other emulators.\nSadly development only lasted 3 months before all signs of development vanished, leaving Chankast woefully outdated and buggy.  its a shame development never lasted long enough to really flesh out the emulation, make it more accurate and deal with the various bugs. It’s unknown while development suddenly ceased, but due to it being a closed source project all the work was lost.\nWe recommend using an emulator such as Demul or NullDC instead as they have been kept in development much longer, becoming more superior in speed, emulation accuracy and more robust emulation.",

One of the most popular of these tools being DAEMON Tools.\nBasically the only downside to SSF is that it is Windows only, but for Windows users it is the best available SEGA Saturn Emulator.",

Luckily for those who are interested in the SEGA Saturn there have been two emulators that have really picked up the slack in development surround\nWhile the years have gone on now, we sadly can no longer recommend Satourne. Both SSF and Yabause are much more capable emulators now. If your on a Windows System be sure to check out SSF and for those on other systems check out Yabause.",

For the majority of its development it was considered as one of the best SEGA Genesis Emulators available. It has superseded other forks of the Gens Emulator, including Gens Plus!\nWhile being built off Gens, Gens32 Surreal adds an assortment of extra functionality to the emulator. The extra technical features the Gens32 Surreal team implemented is namely. The LDU System, a system designed so games can be translated extremely easy, a caption systems to captions can be easily added into games, much like you see in DVD’s. Along these various features it also has the ability to replace the background music in any game and features an inbuilt Kailleria client for netplay.\nAlongside all these extra features, Gens32 Surreal is a highly capable and compatible emulator in its own right, offering emulation for the vast majority of the SEGA Genesis games.",

Ultimately it is designed to act as a very thorough and useful debugger for game development purposes.\nThe author recommends using other emulators instead of this if your intention is to play games on a day to day basis.

            "description": "Xenia is the one, and only Xbox 360 Emulator. Developed originally by Ben Vanik while he was between jobs and needed something to bide his time in the meantime. He noticed that there was a sheer lack of any progress or any interest in developing an emulator for the Xbox 360, so then the Xenia Xbox 360 emulator project was born.\nXenia has so far proven to be a very fruitful project, starting back in 2013, actually successfully managing to run a Xbox 360 game on PC seemed just like a pipe dream. After the sheer lack of any successful original Xbox emulators, many thought that the Xbox 360 would end up facing the same fate. However Xenia has now proven otherwise, while 3 years might seem like a lot of time, for a complicated system like the Xbox 360 its amazing what the team have managed to achieve.\nAs of August 2016, there is just over 50 titles that can now be successfully ran on the emulator while managing to achieve full speed. This is an incredibly impressive feat and shows that the emulator is well on its way to being able to successfully emulate the whole system. With any luck more developers will come to the project and help speed up work and help find improvements in the pre-existing code.\nWhile Xenia is making a lot of progress, there is a couple of things that are worth noting. One you <strong>require</strong> a 64bit operating system, so don’t bother trying this if you have a 32bit operating system. The emulator relies on Advanced Vector Extensions 2 (AVX2) meaning you will have to ensure that your processor actually supports this feature set, there is no way around this due to the way certain things work on the Xbox 360. It is also recommended by the developers to use a NVIDIA GPU and an Intel processor.",

Despite this though CXBX is one of the more promising attempts at getting the Xbox games to run on other platforms. But sadly, development seems to be all but ceased, and now there is only one real promising emulator that is left in development.

Xeon was only ever capable of being able to run one single Xbox game, and that game is Halo: Combat Evolved.\nEven though it could get in game, it was simply way to slow to be able to ever run the game at any playable speed.\nHowever what Xeon did show, despite its short life span, is that emulation of the original Xbox can be achieved and wasn’t an impossible task, sadly development of all Xbox emulators has not managed to progress much further.\nWhile emulation of the Xbox has been fairly stagnant there is one project left in development, that being XQEMU. There is still some hope in that the XQEMU project will manage to achieve a higher level of emulation\nDespite such an early promise of being able to emulate Xbox games, Xeon never had another release and was left as yet another abandoned Xbox emulator.",

It also made use of Aaron Giles work on M.A.M.E. \nIn particular it was the CoJag driver that was part of M.A.M.E, it also combined this with the Starscream 68000 emulator core.\nOver the years though the core has been replaced with several different iterations and has been rewritten by various developers. The current core is a heavily customized version of UAE’s 68000 core.\nThe Virtual Jaguar emulator manages to emulate all the major subsystems of the Atari Jaguar to varying degrees. So far they should be highly compatible, but like all things, it needs continuous work to eventually emulate the cores exactly and be able to successfully replicate the Atari Jaguar without any issues.",

Even managing to emulate some commercial games sound successfully. However for its time, it required what was classified as “high end” specs for that era. That being it required a processor that had a clock speed of over 2 GHz for it to be able to run games at full speed, and also actually achieve sound emulation.\nPlease note: Project Tempest has gone without development for some time now, while a capable emulator we do recommend using Virtual Jaguar Instead.",

Thanks to the portable nature of the code, ports for various different operating systems and video game consoles became common.\nAfter David Firth stopped his own personal work on Atari800 in 1997 a group of talented programmers moved to take over development of the emulator themselves, Building off of the core 0.8.0 source code that David Firth had released, it quickly became one of the best Atari 5200 emulators available. Spurred even more so after numerous developers began working on the emulator alongside the new core development team.",

While z26 is one of the best ones at emulating the Atari 2600 it is however one of the more complex ones to setup.

            "shortDesc": "PC Atari Emulator was one of the very first Atari 2600 emulators. It is a highly optimized emulator with a very easy to use interface.",
            "description": "PC Atari Emulator is now a rather outdated Atari 2600 Emulator for the Windows operating system. It was highly regarded for being incredibly well optimized, and easy to use.\nIts speed was thanks to the sheer amount of effort that was put into hand crafting assembly code. The assembly code was heavily optimized for the Pentium processors of the day.\nWhile it locked the emulator to a single operating system, it did prove to be a significant enough speed improvement.\nAtari PC Emulator boosted server other features such as full collision checking, the support for every single bank switching scheme.\nThe ability to emulate the Atari’s vast amount of controls, among a vast amount of other features helped set Atari PC Emulator apart from all the others early on.\nSadly though, development of  the emulator ceased in 2002.",
